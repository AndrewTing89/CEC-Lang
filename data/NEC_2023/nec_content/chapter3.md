Exception: In the case of circuits supplying vacuum or electric-discharge lighting systems or signs or X-ray apparatus, the currents carried by the conductors are so small that the inductive heating effect can be ignored where these conductors are placed in metal enclosures or pass through metal.

Informational Note: Because aluminum is not a magnetic metal, there will be no heating due to hysteresis; however, induced currents will be present. They will not be of sufficient magnitude to require grouping of conductors or special treatment in passing conductors through aluminum wall sections.

(2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.

Exception: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 fi) or 10 percent of the total circuit.

Informational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.

(3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded.

Informational Note No. 1: See Table 310.4(1) and Table 315.10(A) for the temperature rating of a conductor that is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:

- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.

(3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium, Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.

The temperature correction and adjustment factors shall be permitted to be applied to the ampacity for the temperature rating of the conductor, if the corrected and adjusted ampacity does not exceed the ampacity for the temperature rating of the termination in accordance with 110.14(C).

- (2) Coordination with circuit and system overcurrent protection
- (3) Compliance with the requirements of product listings or certifications.
- (4) Preservation of the safety benefits of established industry practices and standardized procedures

Informational Note No. 2: See Chapter 9, Table 8, Conductor Properties, for conductor area. Interpolation is based on the conductor circularmil area and not the conductor overall area.

T, = ambient temperature used in the table (°C)
