### Part I. General

#### 400.1 Scope

This article covers general requirements, applications, and construction specifications for flexible cords and flexible cables.

#### 400.2 Other Articles

Flexible cords and flexible cables shall comply with this article and with the applicable provisions of other articles of this Code.

#### 400.3 Suitability

Flexible cords and flexible cables and their associated fittings shall be suitable for the conditions of use and location.

#### 400.4 Types

Flexible cords and flexible cables shall conform to the description in Table 400.4. The use of flexible cords and flexible cables other than those in Table 400.4 shall require permission by the authority having jurisdiction.

#### 400.5 Ampacities for Flexible Cords and Flexible Cables.

##### (A) Ampacity Tables

Table 400.5(A) (1) provides the ampacities for flexible cords and flexible cables, and Table 400.5(A) (2) provides the ampacities for flexible cords and flexible cables with not more than three current-carrying conductors. These tables shall be used in conjunction with applicable enduse product standards to ensure selection of the proper size and type. Where cords and cables are used in ambient temperatures other than 30°C (86°F), the temperature correction factors from Table 310.15(B)(1)(1) that correspond to the temperature rating of the cord or cable shall be applied to the ampacity in Table 400.5(A)(1) and Table 400.5(A) (2). Cords and cables rated 105°C shall use correction factors in the 90°C column of Table 310.15(B) (1) (1) for temperature correction. Where the number of current-carrying conductors exceeds three, the ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced from the three-conductor rating as shown in Table 400.5 (A) (3).

Informational Note: See Informative Annex B, Table B.2(11), for adjustment factors for more than three current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable with load diversity.

A neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be required to meet the requirements of a current-carrying conductor.

In a 3ewire circuit consisting of two phase conductors and the neutral conductor of a 4wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system, a common conductor carries approximately the same current as the line-to-neutral currents of the other conductors and shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor.

On a 4wire, 3phase, wye circuit where more than 50 percent of the load consists of nonlinear loads, there are harmonic currents present in the neutral conductor and the neutral conductor shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor.

An equipment grounding conductor shall not be considered a current-carrying conductor.

Where a single conductor is used for both equipment grounding and to carry umbalanced current from other conductors, as provided for in 250.140 for electric ranges and electric clothes dryers, it shall not be considered as a currentcarrying conductor.

##### (B) Ultimate Insulation Temperature

In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way with respect to the kind of circuit, the wiring method used, or the number of conductors such that the limiting temperature of the conductors is exceeded.

##### (C) Engineering Supervision

Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated in accordance with 310.14(B).

#### 400.6 Markings.

(1) Horsepower Rating. The rating of the disconnecting means shall be determined from the sum of all currents, including resistance loads, at the ful-load condition and also at

locked-rotor the condition. The combined fulload current and the combined locked-rotor current so obtained shall be considered as a single motor for the purpose of this requirement.

The fullload current equivalent to the horsepower rating of each motor shall be selected from Table 430.247, Table 430.248, Table 430.249, or Table 430.250. These fullload currents shall be added to the rating in amperes of other loads to obtain an equivalent fullload current for the combined load.

The locked-rotor current equivalent to the horsepower rating of each motor shall be selected from Table 430.251 (A) or Table 430.251(B). The locked-rotor currents shall be added to the rating in amperes of other loads to obtain an equivalent locked-rotor current for the combined load. Where two or more motors or other loads cannot be started simultaneously, the largest sum of locked-rotor currents of a motor or group of motors that can be started simultaneously and the fullload currents of other concurrent loads shall be permitted to be used to determine the equivalent locked-rotor current for the simultaneous combined loads. In cases where different current ratings are obtained when applying these tables, the largest value obtained shall be used.

Exception No. 1: The locked-rotor current equivalent to the horsepower rating of each polyphase motor with design letter A shall be one of following:

- (1) If available, the motor's marked value of locked-rotor amperes
- (2) In the absence of a marked value of locked-rotor amperes for the motor, the value calculated from Equation 430.110(C)(L)a:

## [430.110(C) (1)a]

$$
\text{locked-rotor amperes} = \left(\frac{kVA}{hp}\right) \times \frac{1000 \times \text{HP}_{\text{rated}}}{\text{V}_{\text{rated}} \times \sqrt{3}}
$$

where:

RVA/hp = maximum range value of kilovolt-amperes per horsepower with lacked rotor in Table 430. 7(B) associated with the motor's marked locked-rotor indicating code letter

Informational Note: Equation 430.110(C)(1)a is obtained by solving for locked-rotor amperes in the formula for "kilovoltamperes per horsepower with locked rotor,' as follows:

## [430.110(C)(1)b]

$$
\frac{kVA}{hp} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \times \text{V}_{\text{rated}} \times \text{I}_{\text{LRA}}}{1000 \times \text{HP}_{\text{rated}}}
$$

The numerator of Equation 430.110(C) (1)b for kilovoltamperes per horsepower is the apparent power input to a threephase motor with locked rotor in units of voltamperes. The factor of 1000 VA/KVA in the denominator converts this value to units of kilovoltamperes and '(marked value of rated horsepower)' in the denominator converts this to kilovolt-amperes per horsepower. Note that "motor's marked value of rated volts" is a line-tosine value and "locked-rotor amperes" is a line value as opposed to a phase value.

Exception No. 2: Where part of the concurrent load is resistance load, and where the disconnecting means is a switch rated in horsepower and current, the switch used shall be permitted to have a horsepower rating not less than the combined load of the motor(s) if the current rating of the switch is not less than the locked-rotor current of the motor(s) plus the resistance load.

Exception: A listed nonfused motor-circuit switch having a horsepower rating equal to or greater than the equivalent horsepower of the combined loads, determined in accordance with 430.110(C)(1), shall be permitted to have a current rating less than 115 percent of the sum of all currents at the full-load condition.

(3) Small Motors. For small motors not covered by Table 430.247, Table 430.248, Table 430.249, or Table 430.250, the locked-rotor current shall be assumed to be six times the fullload current.

The overheating can be the result of reduced motor cooling when its shaft-mounted fan is operating less than rated nameplate RPM. As part of the analysis to determine whether overheating will 'occur, it is necessary to consider the continuous torque capabil-

curves ity

For motors that utilize external forced air or liquid cooling systems, overtemperature can occur if the cooling system is not operating. Although this issue is not unique to adjustable speed applications, externally cooled motors are most often encountered with such applications. In these instances, overtemperature protection using direct temperature sensing \_ is recommended [i.e., 430.126(A) (1), (A) (3), or (A)(4)], or additional means should be provided to ensure that the cooling system is operating (flow or pressure sensing, interlocking of adjustable-speed drive system and cooling system, etc.).
