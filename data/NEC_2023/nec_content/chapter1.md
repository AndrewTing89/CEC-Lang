Informational Note No. 1: This definition and Informational Notes No. 2 and No. 3 have been extracted from NEPA 499-2021, Recommended Practice for the Classification of Combustible Dusts and of Hazardous (Classified) Locations for Electrical Installations in Chemical Process Areas. The NFPA 499 reference is in brackets. Only editorial changes were made to the extracted text to make it consistent with this Code.

Informational Note No. 2: Section 500.5(D) defines a Class III location. Combustible fibers/flyings can be similar in physical form to ignitible fibers/flyings and protected using the same electrical equipment installation methods. Examples of fibers/ flyings include flat platelet-shaped particulate, such as metal flake, and fibrous particulate, such as particle board core material. If the smallest dimension of a combustible material is greater than 500 jum, it is unlikely that the material would be combustible fibers/flyings, as determined by test. Finely divided solids with lengths that are large compared to their diameter or thickness usually do not pass through a 500 jum sieve, yet when tested could potentially be determined to be explosible. [499:A.3.3.4.1]

Informational Note No. 3: See ASTM E1226, Standard Test Method for Explosibility of Dust Clouds, ISO 6184-1, Explosion protection systems - Part 1: Determination of explosion indices of combustible dusts in air, or ISQ/IEC/UL 80079-20-2, Explosive atmospheres Part 20-2: Material characteristics - Combustible dusts test methods, for procedures for determining the explosibility of dusts, A material that is found to not present an explosible mixture could still be an ignitible fiber/flying, as defined in this article. Historically, the explosibility condition has been described as presenting a flash fire or explosion hazard. It could be understood that the potential hazard due to the formation of an explosible mixture when suspended in air at standard atmospheric pressure and temperature would include ignition, [499:A.3.3.4.1]

#### Fibers/Flyings, Ignitible

(Ignitible Fibers/Flyings) Fibers/ flyings where any dimension is greater than 500 pm in nominal size, which are not likely to be in suspension in quantities to produce an explosible mixture, but could produce an ignitible layer fire hazard. [499:3.3.4.2] (CMP-14)

## Fibers/Flyings, Combustible. (Combustible Fibers/Flyings) (Part 3 of 8)
Informational Note No. 2: Section 500.5 of this Code prescribes a Class HII location as one where ignitible fibers/flyings are present, but not likely to be in suspension in the air in quantities sufficient to produce ignitible mixtures. This description addresses fibers /flyings that do not present a flash-fire hazard or explosion hazard by test. This could be because those fibers/ flyings are too large or too agglomerated to be suspended in air in sufficient concentration, or at all, under typical test con tions. Alternatively, this could be because they burn so slow! that, when suspended in air, they do not propagate combustion at any concentration. In this document the zone classification system includes ignitible fibers/flyings as a fire hazard in a layer, which is not addressed in the IEC zone system (see IEC 60079-10-2, Explosive atmospheres - Part 10-2: Classification of areas - Explosive dust atmospheres).
