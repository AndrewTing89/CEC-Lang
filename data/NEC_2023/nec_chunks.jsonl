(Combustible Fibers/Flyings) (Part 2 of 8)\nInformational Note No. 1: This definition and Informational Notes No. 2 and No. 3 have been extracted from NEPA 499-2021, Recommended Practice for the Classification of Combustible Dusts and of Hazardous (Classified) Locations for Electrical Installations in Chemical Process Areas. The NFPA 499 reference is in brackets. Only editorial changes were made to the extracted text to make it consistent with this Code.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: Section 500.5(D) defines a Class III location. Combustible fibers/flyings can be similar in physical form to ignitible fibers/flyings and protected using the same electrical equipment installation methods. Examples of fibers/ flyings include flat platelet-shaped particulate, such as metal flake, and fibrous particulate, such as particle board core material. If the smallest dimension of a combustible material is greater than 500 jum, it is unlikely that the material would be combustible fibers/flyings, as determined by test. Finely divided solids with lengths that are large compared to their diameter or thickness usually do not pass through a 500 jum sieve, yet when tested could potentially be determined to be explosible. [499:A.3.3.4.1]\n\nInformational Note No. 3: See ASTM E1226, Standard Test Method for Explosibility of Dust Clouds, ISO 6184-1, Explosion protection systems - Part 1: Determination of explosion indices of combustible dusts in air, or ISQ/IEC/UL 80079-20-2, Explosive atmospheres Part 20-2: Material characteristics - Combustible dusts test methods, for procedures for determining the explosibility of dusts, A material that is found to not present an explosible mixture could still be an ignitible fiber/flying, as defined in this article. Historically, the explosibility condition has been described as presenting a flash fire or explosion hazard. It could be understood that the potential hazard due to the formation of an explosible mixture when suspended in air at standard atmospheric pressure and temperature would include ignition, [499:A.3.3.4.1]\n\n#### Fibers/Flyings, Ignitible\n\n(Ignitible Fibers/Flyings) Fibers/ flyings where any dimension is greater than 500 pm in nominal size, which are not likely to be in suspension in quantities to produce an explosible mixture, but could produce an ignitible layer fire hazard.

The NFPA 499 reference is in brackets. Only editorial changes were made to the extracted text to make it consistent with this Code.\n\n## Fibers/Flyings, Combustible. (Combustible Fibers/Flyings) (Part 3 of 8)\nInformational Note No. 2: Section 500.5 of this Code prescribes a Class HII location as one where ignitible fibers/flyings are present, but not likely to be in suspension in the air in quantities sufficient to produce ignitible mixtures. This description addresses fibers /flyings that do not present a flash-fire hazard or explosion hazard by test. This could be because those fibers/ flyings are too large or too agglomerated to be suspended in air in sufficient concentration, or at all, under typical test con tions. Alternatively, this could be because they burn so slow! that, when suspended in air, they do not propagate combustion at any concentration. In this document the zone classification system includes ignitible fibers/flyings as a fire hazard in a layer, which is not addressed in the IEC zone system (see IEC 60079-10-2, Explosive atmospheres - Part 10-2: Classification of areas - Explosive dust atmospheres).

A protective device integral with a motor that will protect the motor against damage due to failure to start shall be permitted if the motor is part of an approved assembly that does not normally subject the motor to overloads. (4) Larger Than 1500 Horsepower. For motors larger than 1500 hp, a protective device having embedded temperature detectors that cause current to the motor to be interrupted when the motor attains a temperature rise greater than marked on the nameplate in an ambient temperature of 40°C. (B) One Horsepower or Less, Automatically Started. Any motor of 1 hp or less that is started automatically shall be protected against overload by one of the following means. (1) Separate Overload Device. By a separate overload device following the requirements of 430.32(A) (1). For a multispeed motor, each winding connection shall be considered separately. Modification of this value shall be permitted as provided in 430.32(C). (2) Thermal Protector or Electronically Protected. A thermal protector integral with the motor shall be approved for use with the motor that it protects on the basis that it will prevent dangerous overheating of the motor due to overload and failure to start. An electronically protected motor shall be approved for use on the basis that it will prevent dangerous overheating due to the failure of the electronic control, overload, or failure to start the motor. Where the motor currentinterrupting device is separate from the motor and its control circuit is operated by a protective device integral with the motor, it shall be arranged so that the opening of the control circuit results in interruption of current to the motor. (3) Integral with Motor. A protective device integral with a motor that protects the motor against damage due to failure to start shall be permitted (1) if the motor is part of an approved assembly that does not subject the motor to overloads, or (2) if the assembly is also equipped with other safety controls (such as the safety combustion controls on a domestic oil burner) that protect the motor against damage due to failure to start. Where the assembly has safety controls that protect the motor, it shall be so indicated on the nameplate of the assembly where it will be visible after installation. (4) Impedance-Protected. If the impedance of the motor windings is sufficient to prevent overheating due to failure to start, the motor shall be permitted to be protected as specified in 430.32(D)(2)a. for manually started motors if the motor is part of an approved assembly in which the motor will limit itself so that it will not be dangerously overheated. Informational Note: Many ac motors of less than % hp, such as clock motors, series motors, and so forth, and also some larger motors such as torque motors, come within this classification. It does not include split-phase motors having automatic switches that disconnect the starting windings. (C) Selection of Overload Device. Where the sensing element or setting or sizing of the overload device selected in accordance with 430.32(A)(1) and 430.32(B)(1) is not sufficient to start the motor or to carry the load, higher size sensing elements or incremental settings or sizing shall be permitted to be used, provided the trip current of the overload device does not exceed the following percentage of motor nameplate fullload current rating: Motors with marked service factor 1.15 or greater 140% Motors with a marked temperature rise 40°C or 140% less All other motors If not shunted during the starting period of the motor as provided in 430.35, the overload device shall have sufficient time delay to permit the motor to start and accelerate its load. Informational Note: A Class 20 overload relay will provide a longer motor acceleration time than a Class 10 or Class 10A. overload relay. A Class 30 overload relay will provide a longer motor acceleration time than a Class 20 overload relay. Use of a higher class overload relay may preclude the need for selection ofa higher trip current. (D) One Horsepower or Less, Nonautomatically Started. (1) Permanently Installed. Overload protection shall be in accordance with 430.32(B). (2) Not Permanently Installed. a. Within Sight from Controller.

The secondary circuits of wound-rotor ac motors, including conductors, controllers, resistors, and so forth, shall be permitted to be protected against overload by the motor-overload device. 430.33 Intermittent and Similar Duty. A motor used for a condition of service that is inherently short-time, intermittent, periodic, or varying duty, as illustrated by Table 430.22(E), shall be permitted to be protected against overload by the branchcircuit short-circuit and ground-fault protective device, provided the protective device rating or setting does not exceed that specified in Table 430.52(C) (1). Any motor application shall be considered to be for continuous duty unless the nature of the apparatus it drives is such that the motor cannot operate continuously with load under any condition of use. 430.35 Shunting During Starting Period. (A) Nonautomatically Started. For a nonautomatically started motor, the overload protection shall be permitted to be shunted or cut out of the circuit during the starting period of the motor if the device by which the overload protection is shunted or cut out cannot be left in the starting position and if fuses or inverse time circuit breakers rated or set at not over 400 percent of the full-load current of the motor are located in the circuit so as to be operative during the starting period of the motor.

As part of the analysis to determine whether overheating will 'occur, it is necessary to consider the continuous torque capabil-\n\ncurves ity\n\nFor motors that utilize external forced air or liquid cooling systems, overtemperature can occur if the cooling system is not operating. Although this issue is not unique to adjustable speed applications, externally cooled motors are most often encountered with such applications. In these instances, overtemperature protection using direct temperature sensing \\_ is recommended [i.e., 430.126(A) (1), (A) (3), or (A)(4)], or additional means should be provided to ensure that the cooling system is operating (flow or pressure sensing, interlocking of adjustable-speed drive system and cooling system, etc.).\n\nfor the motor given the application requirements. This will assist in determining whether the motor overload protection will be able, on its own, to provide protection against overheating. These overheating protection requirements are only intended to apply to applications where an adjustablespeed drive, as defined in Article 100, is used.\n\n##### (B) Multiple Motor Applications\n\nFor multiple motor applica~ tions, individual motor overtemperature protection shall be provided as required in 430.126(A).\n\n##### (C) Automatic Restarting and Orderly Shutdown\n\n430.43 and 430.44 shall apply to the motor overtemperature protection means.", "chapter": 4, "chapter_title": "Equipment for General Use", "article": 430, "article_title": "Motors, Motor Circuits, and Controllers", "part": "X", "part_title": "Adjustable-Speed Drive Systems", "section": "430.126", "section_title": "Motor Overtemperature Protection.", "full_section_path": "430.126", "parent_sections": ["430", "Part X", "430.126"], "token_count": 706, "has_formulas": false, "subsection_level": 0}
