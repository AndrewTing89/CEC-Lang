Multiply base ampacity by appropriate correction factor based on actual ambient temperature and conductor temperature rating (60°C, 75°C, or 90°C). Used for conductors in attics, near heat sources, or in hot/cold climates. Higher ambient temperatures reduce ampacity; lower temperatures increase ampacity.

Used for overhead conductors per Article 225, cable tray single conductor layouts per 392.80(A)(2)(c), festooning applications, and other installations where conductors are not enclosed.

Used for typical wall-mount panels and cabinets with top/bottom conductor entry where wires make 90-degree bends to horizontal terminations (like circuit breakers). Space requirements increase with conductor size (14 AWG through 2000 kcmil) and number of wires per terminal (1-5 wires). Measured in straight line from lug/connector end to wall/obstruction. Separate column for compact stranded AA-8000 aluminum alloy conductors which allows smaller bending space. Required by NEC 312.6(A) to ensure proper bending radius prevents insulation damage and mechanical stress on conductors.",

Lists common box types (round, octagonal, square, device, masonry, FS, FD) with dimensions in mm/inches and cubic inch volumes. Shows maximum conductor count for each wire size from 18 AWG through 6 AWG. Used with box fill calculations per 314.16(B) which require counting conductors plus volume allowances for cable clamps, devices (2 conductor equivalent each), and grounding conductors (1 conductor equivalent for all). Critical for preventing overcrowded boxes that can cause faults, arcing, overheating, or fires. All conductors entering box count once; pigtails that don't leave box don't count. Required by NEC 314.16(A) for proper metal box sizing to ensure safe installation.",

      "description": "Specifies required insulation thickness for shielded medium voltage conductors rated 2001-35,000 volts based on conductor size, voltage rating, and insulation level percentage. Three insulation levels provided: 100% level for grounded systems with rapid fault clearing (under 1 minute), 133% level for systems where neutral voltage varies from line-to-ground voltage, and 173% level for ungrounded systems or longer fault clearing times. Covers six voltage ranges: 2001-5000V, 5001-8000V, 8001-15,000V, 15,001-25,000V, 25,001-28,000V, and 28,001-35,000V. Minimum conductor sizes increase with voltage: 2 AWG minimum for lower voltages up to 1 AWG for 15kV+ systems. Insulation thickness ranges from 2.29mm (90 mils) at lowest voltage/100% level to 14.73mm (580 mils) at 35kV/173% level. Required by NEC 315.10(C) for shielded MV cable construction standards to ensure safe operation based on system grounding and fault protection capabilities.",

Minimum sizes increase with voltage level: 8 AWG minimum for 2001-5000V systems, 6 AWG for 5001-8000V, 2 AWG for 8001-15,000V, 1 AWG for 15,001-28,000V, and 1/0 AWG for 28,001-35,000V systems. These minimums ensure adequate mechanical strength and current-carrying capacity for MV applications in industrial, commercial, and utility distribution systems. Note that some manufacturers may not produce MV cables in the smallest allowable sizes, so availability should be verified during design phase.

Installation method means conduit containing three-conductor cable is in free air (not buried or embedded) allowing external cooling through conduit walls. Three-conductor cable has mutual heating within cable jacket, plus conduit confinement further reduces ampacity. Aluminum ampacities approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper cable ratings. Ampacities range from 41A for 8 AWG to 615A for 1000 kcmil. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions.

      "caption": "Ampacities of Three Single-Insulated Copper Conductors in Underground Electrical Ducts (Three Conductors per Electrical Duct)",
      "description": "Provides ampacity ratings for three single copper medium voltage conductors installed together in underground electrical ducts (conduit buried in earth). Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 1000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Separate columns for 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V voltage ranges. Table organized by number of circuits in duct bank: One Circuit (highest ampacity), Three Circuits (moderate ampacity reduction), and Six Circuits (lowest ampacity due to mutual heating from adjacent ducts). Installation method means three conductors bundled in single underground conduit. Based on earth temperature 20°C (68°F), RHO 90 thermal resistivity. Ampacities range from 48A (8 AWG, 6 circuits) to 720A (1000 kcmil, 1 circuit). Most common underground MV installation method for industrial facilities, utility substations, and commercial distribution. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(11) for proper copper MV conductor ampacity determination in underground duct banks.",

      "description": "Provides ampacity ratings for three single aluminum medium voltage conductors installed together in underground electrical ducts. Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 1000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Separate columns for 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V voltage ranges. Table organized by number of circuits in duct bank: One Circuit, Three Circuits, and Six Circuits. Aluminum ampacities approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper ratings. Based on earth temperature 20°C, RHO 90 thermal resistivity. Ampacities range from 38A (8 AWG, 6 circuits) to 590A (1000 kcmil, 1 circuit). Used for underground MV distribution where cost savings justify aluminum. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(12) for proper aluminum MV conductor ampacity determination in underground duct banks.",

Covers 8 AWG-1000 kcmil, MV-90/MV-105, 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V. Three sections: One Circuit (59-645A), Three Circuits (53-520A), Six Circuits (46-420A). Lower ampacities than individual conductors due to mutual heating within cable jacket plus duct confinement. Earth temperature 20°C, RHO 90. Common for underground installations where single cable pull preferred. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(13).",

Based on earth 20°C, RHO 90, burial depth per 300.5(A). Ampacities 30-50% higher than duct bank due to direct earth contact cooling. Common for utility transmission, large industrial feeders, and remote installations where trenching possible. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(15) for copper MV direct burial.",

Covers 8 AWG-1000 kcmil, MV-90/MV-105, 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V. Two sections: One Circuit 3-conductors (85-840A) and Two Circuits 6-conductors (80-765A). Aluminum ampacities ~75-80% of copper equivalent. Ampacities 30-50% higher than duct bank due to direct earth contact cooling. Common for cost-effective underground MV distribution where trenching feasible. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(16) for aluminum MV direct burial.",

      "description": "Copper triplexed (three single conductors bundled together) directly buried in earth without conduit. Three-phase set bundled and buried for optimal heat dissipation. Covers 8 AWG-1000 kcmil, MV-90/MV-105, 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V. Two sections: One Circuit 3-conductors (90-885A) and Two Circuits 6-conductors (85-795A). Higher ampacities than three-conductor cable due to less restrictive bundling. Direct earth contact provides better cooling than duct bank. Common for underground MV feeders where individual conductor flexibility needed. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(19) for copper triplexed direct burial.",

Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 1000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Separate columns for 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V voltage ranges. Aluminum ampacities are approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper ratings due to higher resistance. Triplexed configuration means three single conductors bundled together for three-phase power distribution. Ampacities range from 50A for 8 AWG to 800A for 1000 kcmil. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions. Used for sizing aluminum MV conductors in aerial installations, cable trays, or other free-air applications where cost savings justify aluminum use. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(2) for proper MV aluminum conductor ampacity determination in triplexed air installations.",

      "description": "Provides highest ampacity ratings for single copper medium voltage conductors installed isolated in free air with maximum heat dissipation. Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 2000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Three voltage range columns: 2001-5000V, 5001-15000V, and 15001-35000V. Isolated installation means conductors spaced apart (not touching or bundled) allowing maximum cooling from all sides, resulting in highest possible ampacities compared to other installation methods. Ampacities range from 83A for 8 AWG to 1790A for 2000 kcmil at highest temperature rating. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions. Most commonly used for overhead transmission lines, large industrial motor feeders, and utility distribution where conductors can be widely spaced. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(3) for proper MV copper conductor ampacity determination in isolated air installations providing maximum heat dissipation.",

Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 2000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Three voltage range columns: 2001-5000V, 5001-15000V, and 15001-35000V. Isolated installation means conductors spaced apart (not touching or bundled) allowing maximum cooling, resulting in highest possible ampacities for aluminum conductors. Aluminum ampacities are approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper ratings. Ampacities range from 64A for 8 AWG to 1475A for 2000 kcmil at highest temperature rating. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions. Used for overhead transmission lines, large industrial applications, and utility distribution where aluminum's cost advantages justify its use and conductors can be widely spaced for cooling. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(4) for proper MV aluminum conductor ampacity determination in isolated air installations.",

Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 1000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Separate columns for 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V voltage ranges. Aluminum three-conductor cable construction with all phases under common jacket/sheath results in lower ampacities than individual isolated conductors. Aluminum ampacities approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper cable ratings. Ampacities range from 46A for 8 AWG to 705A for 1000 kcmil. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions. Commonly used for underground duct banks, direct burial, and indoor installations where cost savings justify aluminum and single three-phase cable preferred over three separate cables. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(6) for proper MV three-conductor aluminum cable ampacity determination in isolated air installations.",

      "description": "Provides ampacity ratings for aluminum medium voltage conductors installed as three single conductors or triplexed set within an isolated conduit exposed to air. Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 1000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Separate columns for 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V voltage ranges. Installation method means conduit containing three-phase conductors is in free air (not buried or embedded) allowing external cooling, but conductors within conduit have reduced ampacity compared to isolated in free air. Aluminum ampacities approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper ratings. Ampacities range from 43A for 8 AWG to 645A for 1000 kcmil. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions. Used for above-ground conduit runs, rooftop installations, cable tray with conduit, exposed conduit systems where aluminum cost savings justify its use. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(8) for proper MV aluminum conductor ampacity determination in isolated conduit in air installations.",

      "description": "Provides thermal expansion data for rigid PVC conduit to design expansion joints and prevent buckling or pulling from boxes. PVC expands significantly with temperature change (coefficient 6.084×10⁻⁵ per °C). Shows length change per meter (or per 100 feet) for temperature changes from 5°F to 200°F (5°C to 100°C). Example: 100°F temperature rise causes 4.06 inches expansion per 100 feet of PVC conduit. Critical for long conduit runs exposed to sunlight, rooftops, or outdoor installations with wide temperature swings. Expansion joints required when calculated movement exceeds ¼ inch. Used to determine expansion joint spacing and design. Common issue in desert climates and roof-mounted installations. Required by NEC 352.44(A) for thermal expansion calculations.",

      "description": "Provides thermal expansion data for RTRC conduit installations. RTRC expands significantly less than PVC (coefficient 2.7×10⁻⁵ vs. 6.084×10⁻⁵ for PVC) - approximately 55% less thermal movement. Shows length change per meter (or per 100 feet) for temperature changes from 5°F to 200°F (5°C to 100°C). Example: 100°F temperature rise causes only 1.80 inches expansion per 100 feet of RTRC compared to 4.06 inches for PVC. Superior dimensional stability makes RTRC preferred for long runs in high-temperature environments. Expansion joints still required but spaced further apart than PVC. Common in outdoor industrial applications, rooftop installations, and corrosive environments. Required by NEC 355.44 for RTRC thermal expansion calculations.",

Two-phase systems rare today but found in older installations, Scott-T transformer systems. Common conductor in 3-wire 2-phase system carries 1.41x listed current. Used for conductor sizing (125% FLA), overload protection, branch circuit protection. Historical installations: early industrial plants, older textile mills. Required by NEC 430.249 for two-phase motor FLA values.",

Protects against short circuits/ground faults, NOT overloads. Most common: dual-element fuse at 175% or inverse time breaker at 250%. Required by NEC 430.52 for motor branch circuit protection sizing.",
