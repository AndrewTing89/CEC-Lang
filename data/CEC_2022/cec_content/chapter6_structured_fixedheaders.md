(C)  Multimotor. Where two or more motors drive a single trolley, truck, or bridge and are controlled as a unit and protected by a single set of overload devices with a rating equal to the sum of their rated full-load currents, a hoist or trolley shall  be  considered  to  be  protected  if  the  sensing  device  is connected in the hoist's upper limit switch circuit so as to prevent further hoisting during an overtemperature condition of either motor.

(D)  Hoists and Monorail Hoists. Hoists and monorail hoists and their trolleys that are not used as part of an overhead traveling  crane  shall  not  require  individual  motor  overload  protection, provided the largest motor does not exceed 7 1 /2 hp and all motors are under manual control of the operator.

### Part II.  Conductors

#### 620.11  Insulation of Conductors. The insulation of conductors shall comply with 620.11(A) through (D).

Informational Note:  One method of determining that the insulation of conductors is flame retardant is by testing the  conductors  or  cables  to  the  VW-1  (Vertical-Wire) Flame Test in ANSI/UL 1581-2011, Reference Standard for Electrical Wires, Cables, and Flexible Cords .

(A)  Hoistway Door Interlock Wiring. The conductors to the hoistway door interlocks from the hoistway riser shall be one of the following:

- (1) Flame retardant and suitable for a temperature of not less than 200°C (392°F). Conductors shall be Type SF or equivalent.
- (2)  Physically protected using an approved method, such that the conductor assembly is flame retardant and suitable for a temperature of not less than 200°C (392°F).

(B)  Traveling Cables. Traveling cables used as flexible connections between the elevator or dumbwaiter car or counterweight and the raceway shall be of the types of elevator cable listed in Table 400.4 or other approved types.

(C)  Other  Wiring. All  conductors  in  raceways  shall  have flame-retardant insulation.

Conductors  shall  be  Type  MTW,  TF,  TFF,  TFN,  TFFN, THHN, THW, THWN, TW, XHHW, hoistway cable, or any other conductor with insulation designated as flame retardant.

Shielded conductors shall be permitted if such conductors are insulated for the maximum nominal circuit voltage applied to any conductor within the cable or raceway system.

(D)  Insulation. All conductors shall have an insulation voltage rating  equal  to  at  least  the  maximum  nominal  circuit  voltage applied  to  any  conductor  within  the  enclosure,  cable,  or  raceway. Insulations and outer coverings that are marked for limited smoke and are so listed shall be permitted.

#### 620.12  Minimum Size of Conductors. The minimum size of conductors, other than conductors that form an integral part of control equipment, shall be in accordance with 620.12(A) and (B).

(A)  Traveling Cables.

(1)  Lighting  Circuits. For  lighting  circuits,  14  AWG  copper, 20 AWG copper or larger conductors shall be permitted in parallel, provided the ampacity is equivalent to at least that of 14 AWG copper.

(2)  Other Circuits. For other circuits, 20 AWG copper.

(B)  Other Wiring. 24 AWG copper. Smaller size listed conductors shall be permitted.

#### 620.13  Feeder and Branch-Circuit Conductors. Conductors shall have an ampacity in accordance with 620.13(A) through (D). With generator field control, the conductor ampacity shall be based on the nameplate current rating of the driving motor of the motor-generator set that supplies power to the elevator motor.

Informational  Note  No.  1:  The  heating  of  conductors depends on root-mean-square current values, which, with generator field control, are reflected by the nameplate current  rating  of  the  motor-generator  driving  motor  rather than by the rating of the elevator motor, which represents actual but short-time and intermittent full-load current values.

Informational Note No. 2:  See Informational Note, Informational Note Figure 620.13, No. 2.

(A)  Conductors Supplying Single Motor. Conductors supplying a single motor shall have an ampacity not less than the percentage of motor nameplate current determined from 430.22(A) and (E).

Informational  Note:  Some  elevator  motor  currents,  or those motor currents of similar function, exceed the motor nameplate value. Heating of the motor and conductors is dependent on the root-mean square (rms) current value and the length of operation time. Because this motor application is inherently intermittent duty, conductors are sized for duty cycle service as shown in Table 430.22(E).

(B)  Conductors Supplying a Single Motor Controller. Conductors supplying a single motor controller shall have an ampacity not less than the motor controller nameplate current rating, plus all other connected loads. Motor controller nameplate current ratings shall be permitted to be derived based on the rms

Informational Note Figure 620.13  Single-Line Diagram. ∆

<!-- image -->

value of the motor current using an intermittent duty cycle and other control system loads, if present.

(C)  Conductors  Supplying  a  Single  Power  Transformer. Conductors supplying a single power transformer shall have an ampacity not less than the nameplate current rating of the power transformer plus all other connected loads.

Informational Note No. 1:  The nameplate current rating of a power transformer supplying a motor controller reflects the nameplate current rating of the motor controller at line voltage (transformer primary).

Informational  Note  No.  2:  See  Informative  Annex  D, Example No. D10.

(D)  Conductors Supplying More Than One Motor, Motor Controller,  or  Power  Transformer. Conductors  supplying more than one motor, motor controller, or power transformer shall have an ampacity not less than the sum of the nameplate current ratings of the equipment plus all other connected loads. The  ampere  ratings  of  motors  to  be  used  in  the  summation shall be determined from Table 430.22(E), 430.24, and 430.24, Exception No. 1.

Table 620.14  Feeder Demand Factors for Elevators

*Demand factors are based on 50 percent duty cycle (i.e., half time on and half time off).

Informational Note:  See Informative Annex D, Example Nos. D9 and D10.

#### 620.14  Feeder  Demand  Factor. Feeder  conductors  of  less ampacity than required by 620.13 shall be permitted, subject to the requirements of Table 620.14.

#### 620.15  Motor Controller Rating. The motor controller rating shall comply with 430.83. The rating shall be permitted to be less than the nominal rating of the elevator motor, when the controller inherently limits the available power to the motor and is marked as power limited.

Informational Note:  For controller markings, see 430.8.

#### 620.16  Short-Circuit Current Rating.

(A)  Marking. Where an elevator control panel is installed, it shall be marked with its short-circuit current rating, based on one of the following:

- (1)  Short-circuit current rating of a listed assembly
- (2) Short-circuit current rating established utilizing an approved method

Informational Note:  UL 508A-2013, Standard for Industrial Control Panels, Supplement SB, is an example of an approved method.

(B)  Installation. The  elevator  control  panel  shall  not  be installed where the available fault current exceeds its short-circuit current rating, as marked in accordance with 620.16(A).

This requirement allows up to six disconnecting means to disconnect a single PV system. For PV systems where all power is converted through interactive inverters, a dedicated circuit breaker, in 705.12(B)(1), is an example of a single PV system disconnecting means.

(D)  Ratings. The PV system disconnecting means shall have ratings sufficient for the maximum circuit current, available fault current, and voltage that is available at the terminals of the PV system disconnect.

•

(E)  Type of Disconnect. The PV system disconnecting means shall simultaneously disconnect the PV system conductors that are  not  solidly  grounded  from  all  conductors  of  other  wiring systems.

Equipment disconnecting means, where used, shall be one of the types in 690.13(E)(1) through (E)(5).

Equipment disconnecting means, other than those complying with 690.33, shall be marked in accordance with the warning in 690.13(B) if the line and load terminals can be energized in the open position.

Informational Note:  A common installation practice is to terminate PV source-side dc conductors in the same manner that utility source-side ac conductors are generally connected on the line side of a disconnecting means. This practice is more likely to de-  energize load-side terminals, blades, and fuses when the disconnect is in the open position and no energized sources are connected to the load side of the disconnect.
