Exception: In the case of circuits supplying vacuum or electricdischarge lighting systems or signs or X-ray apparatus, the currents carried by the conductors are so small that the inductive heating effect can be ignored where these conductors are placed in metal enclosures or pass through metal.

Informational Note: Because aluminum is not a magnetic metal, there will be no heating due to hysteresis; however, induced currents will be present. They will not be of sufficient magnitude to require grouping of conductors or special treatment in passing conductors through aluminum wall sections.

Informational Note: Directories of electrical construction materials published by qualified testing laboratories contain many listing installation restrictions necessary to maintain the fire-resistive rating of assemblies where penetrations or openings are made. Building codes also contain restrictions on membrane penetrations on opposite sides of a fire-resistance-rated wall assembly. An example is the 600-mm (24-in.) minimum horizontal separation that usually applies between boxes installed on opposite sides of the wall. Assistance in complying with 300.21 can be found in building codes, fire resistance directories, and product listings.

#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts


##### (A) General.

- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆


Informational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.

Informational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .

- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.


Exception: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.

Informational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.

- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆


Informational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:

- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.

- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.

- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.

- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.


Informational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.

##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).


<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where:

T c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)

T a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)

Rdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc

Y c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect

Rca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient

Under engineering supervision, ampacities of sizes not shown in ampacity tables for conductors meeting the general wiring requirements shall be permitted to be determined by interpolation of the adjacent conductors based on the conductor's area. N


The temperature correction and adjustment factors shall be permitted to be applied to the ampacity for the temperature rating of the conductor, if the corrected and adjusted ampacity does not exceed the ampacity for the temperature rating of the termination in accordance with the provisions of 110.14(C).

Informational Note No. 1: Table 310.16 through Table 310.19 are application tables for use in determining conductor sizes on loads calculated in accordance with Article 220. Ampacities result from consideration of one or more of the following:

- (1) Temperature compatibility with connected equipment, especially the connection points.

- (2) Coordination with circuit and system overcurrent protection.

- (3) Compliance with the requirements of product listings or certifications. See 110.3(B).

- (4) Preservation of the safety benefits of established industry practices and standardized procedures.


Informational Note No. 2: For conductor area see Chapter 9, Table 8, Conductor Properties. Interpolation is based on the conductor area and not the conductor overall area.

Informational Note No. 3: For the ampacities of flexible cords and cables, see 400.5. For the ampacities of fixture wires, see 402.5.

Informational Note No. 4: For explanation of type letters used in tables and for recognized sizes of conductors for the various conductor insulations, see Table 310.4(A) and Table 310.4(B). For installation requirements, see 310.1 through 310.14 and the various articles of this Code . For flexible cords, see Table 400.4, Table 400.5(A)(a), and Table 400.5(A)(b).

## (B) Ambient Temperature Correction Factors. ∆

- (1) General. Ampacities for ambient temperatures other than those shown in the ampacity tables shall be corrected in accordance with Table 310.15(B)(1) or Table 310.15(B)(2), or shall be permitted to be calculated using Equation 310.15(B). N


<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where:

I ′ = ampacity corrected for ambient temperature

I = ampacity shown in the tables

Tc = temperature rating of conductor (°C)

Ta ′ = new ambient temperature (°C)

Ta = ambient temperature used in the table (°C)

- (2) Rooftop. For raceways or cables exposed to direct sunlight on or above rooftops where the distance above the roof to the bottom of the raceway or cable is less than 23  mm ( 7 /8 in.), a temperature adder of 33°C (60°F) shall be added to the outdoor temperature to determine the applicable ambient temperature for application of the correction factors in Table 310.15(B)(1) or Table 310.15(B)(2). N


Exception: Type XHHW-2 insulated conductors shall not be subject to this ampacity adjustment.

- (2) Raceway Spacing. Spacing between raceways shall be maintained. N


##### (D) Bare or Covered Conductors. Where bare or covered conductors are installed with insulated conductors, the temperature rating of the bare or covered conductor shall be equal to the lowest temperature rating of the insulated conductors for the purpose of determining ampacity.


##### (E) Neutral Conductor. Neutral conductors shall be considered current carrying in accordance with any of the following: ∆
