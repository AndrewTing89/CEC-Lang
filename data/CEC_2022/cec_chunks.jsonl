Adjustable-speed drive systems shall protect against motor overtemperature conditions where the motor is not rated to operate at the nameplate rated current over the speed range required by the application. This protection shall be provided in addition to the conductor protection required in 430.32. Protection shall be provided by one of the following means. ∆\n\n- (1) Motor thermal protector in accordance with 430.32\n\n- (2) Adjustable-speed drive system with load and speedsensitive overload protection and thermal memory retention upon shutdown or power loss\n\n\nException to (2): Thermal memory retention upon shutdown or power loss is not required for continuous duty loads.\n\n- (3) Overtemperature protection relay utilizing thermal sensors embedded in the motor and meeting the requirements of 430.126(A)(2)\n\n- (4) Thermal sensor embedded in the motor whose communications are received and acted upon by an adjustable-speed drive system\n\n\nInformational Note: The relationship between motor current and motor temperature changes when the motor is operated by an adjustable-speed drive. In certain applications, overheating of motors can occur when operated at reduced speed, even at current levels less than a motor's rated full-load current. The overheating can be the result of reduced motor cooling when its shaft-mounted fan is operating less than rated nameplate RPM. As part of the analysis to determine whether overheating will occur, it is necessary to consider the continuous torque capability curves for the motor given the application requirements. This will assist in determining whether the motor overload protection will be able, on its own, to provide protection against overheating. These overheating protection requirements are only intended to apply to applications where an adjustable-speed drive, as defined in Article 100, is used.\n\nFor motors that utilize external forced air or liquid cooling systems, overtemperature can occur if the cooling system is not operating. Although this issue is not unique to adjustable speed applications, externally cooled motors are most often encountered with such applications. In these instances, overtemperature protection using direct temperature sensing is recommended [i.e., 430.126(A)(1), (A)(3), or (A)(4)], or additional means should be  provided to ensure that the cooling system is operating (flow or pressure sensing, interlocking of adjustable-speed drive system and cooling system, etc.).\n\n##### (B) Multiple Motor Applications.

Means shall be provided to disconnect the PV system from all wiring systems including power systems, energy storage systems, and utilization equipment and its associated premises wiring.\n(A)  Location. The PV system disconnecting means shall be installed at a readily accessible location. Where disconnecting means of systems above 30 V are readily accessible to unqualified persons, any enclosure door or hinged cover that exposes live parts when open shall be locked or require a tool to open.\nInformational Note:  PV systems installed in accordance with 690.12 address the concerns related to energized conductors entering a building.\n(B)  Marking. Each  PV  system  disconnecting  means  shall plainly indicate whether in the open (off) or closed (on) position and be permanently marked 'PV SYSTEM DISCONNECT' or equivalent. Additional markings shall be permitted based upon the specific system configuration.

This requirement allows up to six disconnecting means to disconnect a single PV system. For PV systems where all power is converted through interactive inverters, a dedicated circuit breaker, in 705.12(B)(1), is an example of a single PV system disconnecting means.\n(D)  Ratings. The PV system disconnecting means shall have ratings sufficient for the maximum circuit current, available fault current, and voltage that is available at the terminals of the PV system disconnect.\n•\n(E)  Type of Disconnect. The PV system disconnecting means shall simultaneously disconnect the PV system conductors that are  not  solidly  grounded  from  all  conductors  of  other  wiring systems.

This practice is more likely to de-  energize load-side terminals, blades, and fuses when the disconnect is in the open position and no energized sources are connected to the load side of the disconnect.\n- (D)  Type of Disconnecting Means.
