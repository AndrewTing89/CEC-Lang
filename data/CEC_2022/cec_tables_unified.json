      "description": "Specifies required insulation thickness for shielded medium voltage conductors rated 2001-35,000 volts based on conductor size, voltage rating, and insulation level percentage. Three insulation levels provided: 100% level for grounded systems with rapid fault clearing (under 1 minute), 133% level for systems where neutral voltage varies from line-to-ground voltage, and 173% level for ungrounded systems or longer fault clearing times. Covers six voltage ranges: 2001-5000V, 5001-8000V, 8001-15,000V, 15,001-25,000V, 25,001-28,000V, and 28,001-35,000V. Minimum conductor sizes increase with voltage: 2 AWG minimum for lower voltages up to 1 AWG for 15kV+ systems. Insulation thickness ranges from 2.29mm (90 mils) at lowest voltage/100% level to 14.73mm (580 mils) at 35kV/173% level. Required by NEC 315.10(C) for shielded MV cable construction standards to ensure safe operation based on system grounding and fault protection capabilities.",

Installation method means conduit containing three-conductor cable is in free air (not buried or embedded) allowing external cooling through conduit walls. Three-conductor cable has mutual heating within cable jacket, plus conduit confinement further reduces ampacity. Aluminum ampacities approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper cable ratings. Ampacities range from 41A for 8 AWG to 615A for 1000 kcmil. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions.

      "description": "Provides ampacity ratings for three single copper medium voltage conductors installed together in underground electrical ducts (conduit buried in earth). Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 1000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Separate columns for 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V voltage ranges. Table organized by number of circuits in duct bank: One Circuit (highest ampacity), Three Circuits (moderate ampacity reduction), and Six Circuits (lowest ampacity due to mutual heating from adjacent ducts). Installation method means three conductors bundled in single underground conduit. Based on earth temperature 20°C (68°F), RHO 90 thermal resistivity. Ampacities range from 48A (8 AWG, 6 circuits) to 720A (1000 kcmil, 1 circuit). Most common underground MV installation method for industrial facilities, utility substations, and commercial distribution. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(11) for proper copper MV conductor ampacity determination in underground duct banks.",

      "description": "Provides ampacity ratings for three single aluminum medium voltage conductors installed together in underground electrical ducts. Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 1000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Separate columns for 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V voltage ranges. Table organized by number of circuits in duct bank: One Circuit, Three Circuits, and Six Circuits. Aluminum ampacities approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper ratings. Based on earth temperature 20°C, RHO 90 thermal resistivity. Ampacities range from 38A (8 AWG, 6 circuits) to 590A (1000 kcmil, 1 circuit). Used for underground MV distribution where cost savings justify aluminum. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(12) for proper aluminum MV conductor ampacity determination in underground duct banks.",

Covers 8 AWG-1000 kcmil, MV-90/MV-105, 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V. Three sections: One Circuit (59-645A), Three Circuits (53-520A), Six Circuits (46-420A). Lower ampacities than individual conductors due to mutual heating within cable jacket plus duct confinement. Earth temperature 20°C, RHO 90. Common for underground installations where single cable pull preferred. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(13).",

Aluminum ampacities ~75-80% of copper equivalent. Ampacities 30-50% higher than duct bank due to direct earth contact cooling. Common for cost-effective underground MV distribution where trenching feasible. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(16) for aluminum MV direct burial.",

Covers 8 AWG-1000 kcmil, MV-90/MV-105, 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V. Two sections: One Circuit 3-conductors (90-885A) and Two Circuits 6-conductors (85-795A). Higher ampacities than three-conductor cable due to less restrictive bundling. Direct earth contact provides better cooling than duct bank. Common for underground MV feeders where individual conductor flexibility needed. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(19) for copper triplexed direct burial.",

Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 1000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Separate columns for 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V voltage ranges. Aluminum ampacities are approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper ratings due to higher resistance. Triplexed configuration means three single conductors bundled together for three-phase power distribution. Ampacities range from 50A for 8 AWG to 800A for 1000 kcmil. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions. Used for sizing aluminum MV conductors in aerial installations, cable trays, or other free-air applications where cost savings justify aluminum use. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(2) for proper MV aluminum conductor ampacity determination in triplexed air installations.",

      "description": "Provides highest ampacity ratings for single copper medium voltage conductors installed isolated in free air with maximum heat dissipation. Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 2000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Three voltage range columns: 2001-5000V, 5001-15000V, and 15001-35000V. Isolated installation means conductors spaced apart (not touching or bundled) allowing maximum cooling from all sides, resulting in highest possible ampacities compared to other installation methods. Ampacities range from 83A for 8 AWG to 1790A for 2000 kcmil at highest temperature rating. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions. Most commonly used for overhead transmission lines, large industrial motor feeders, and utility distribution where conductors can be widely spaced. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(3) for proper MV copper conductor ampacity determination in isolated air installations providing maximum heat dissipation.",

Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 2000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Three voltage range columns: 2001-5000V, 5001-15000V, and 15001-35000V. Isolated installation means conductors spaced apart (not touching or bundled) allowing maximum cooling, resulting in highest possible ampacities for aluminum conductors. Aluminum ampacities are approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper ratings. Ampacities range from 64A for 8 AWG to 1475A for 2000 kcmil at highest temperature rating. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions. Used for overhead transmission lines, large industrial applications, and utility distribution where aluminum's cost advantages justify its use and conductors can be widely spaced for cooling. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(4) for proper MV aluminum conductor ampacity determination in isolated air installations.",

Aluminum three-conductor cable construction with all phases under common jacket/sheath results in lower ampacities than individual isolated conductors. Aluminum ampacities approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper cable ratings. Ampacities range from 46A for 8 AWG to 705A for 1000 kcmil.

Covers conductor sizes 8 AWG through 1000 kcmil with ratings for both MV-90 (90°C) and MV-105 (105°C) insulation types. Separate columns for 2001-5000V and 5001-35000V voltage ranges. Installation method means conduit containing three-phase conductors is in free air (not buried or embedded) allowing external cooling, but conductors within conduit have reduced ampacity compared to isolated in free air. Aluminum ampacities approximately 75-80% of equivalent copper ratings. Ampacities range from 43A for 8 AWG to 645A for 1000 kcmil. Based on 40°C ambient temperature; requires correction factors from Table 315.60(D)(4) for other conditions. Used for above-ground conduit runs, rooftop installations, cable tray with conduit, exposed conduit systems where aluminum cost savings justify its use. Required by NEC 315.60(C)(8) for proper MV aluminum conductor ampacity determination in isolated conduit in air installations.",

PVC expands significantly with temperature change (coefficient 6.084×10⁻⁵ per °C). Shows length change per meter (or per 100 feet) for temperature changes from 5°F to 200°F (5°C to 100°C). Example: 100°F temperature rise causes 4.06 inches expansion per 100 feet of PVC conduit. Critical for long conduit runs exposed to sunlight, rooftops, or outdoor installations with wide temperature swings. Expansion joints required when calculated movement exceeds ¼ inch. Used to determine expansion joint spacing and design. Common issue in desert climates and roof-mounted installations. Required by NEC 352.44(A) for thermal expansion calculations.",

RTRC expands significantly less than PVC (coefficient 2.7×10⁻⁵ vs. 6.084×10⁻⁵ for PVC) - approximately 55% less thermal movement. Shows length change per meter (or per 100 feet) for temperature changes from 5°F to 200°F (5°C to 100°C). Example: 100°F temperature rise causes only 1.80 inches expansion per 100 feet of RTRC compared to 4.06 inches for PVC. Superior dimensional stability makes RTRC preferred for long runs in high-temperature environments. Expansion joints still required but spaced further apart than PVC. Common in outdoor industrial applications, rooftop installations, and corrosive environments. Required by NEC 355.44 for RTRC thermal expansion calculations.",

Ten standard sizes from 1-5/8×15/16 inch (smallest) to 1-1/2×3 inch (largest). Provides total area, 40% fill area (for external joiners), and 25% fill area (for internal joiners). More restrictive 25% fill when joiners inside channel reduce usable space. Cross-sectional areas range from 0.887 in² to 4.308 in² total. Used for accessible industrial wiring, control circuits, and power distribution in commercial/industrial facilities. Allows easy conductor additions and changes. 40% or 25% fill limits prevent overheating and maintain accessibility. Required by NEC 384.22 for proper strut raceway conductor fill calculations.",

      "description": "Lists cable types permitted for messenger-supported wiring installations per NEC Article 396. Messenger-supported wiring uses tensioned messenger wire (catenary wire) to support cables overhead, common in outdoor industrial facilities, between buildings, and utility applications. Eight permitted cable types: medium-voltage cable (Art. 315), metal-clad cable MC (Art. 330), mineral-insulated MI (Art. 332), multiconductor service-entrance SE/USE (Art. 338), underground feeder UF (Art. 340), power/control tray cable TC (Art. 336), power-limited tray cable, and other approved multiconductor cables. Messenger wire provides mechanical support while cables carry electrical load. Common in industrial plants, refineries, and outdoor distribution systems. Required by NEC 396.10(A) for permitted messenger-supported cable types.",

More than 4 layers requires engineering calculations. Heat cannot dissipate when cable coiled on reel. Common for welding cables, temporary power, construction sites, portable generators. Cable partially deployed from storage reel. Apply factor to Table 400.51(A)(1) base ampacity. Prevents overheating and insulation damage.

      "description": "Most critical motor table: Full-load amperage (FLA) for three-phase AC motors. Two sections: induction motors (squirrel-cage and wound-rotor) and synchronous motors (unity power factor). Voltages: 115V, 200V, 208V, 230V, 460V, 575V, 2300V. Induction motors 1/2 HP (0.9-4.4A) to 500 HP (118-590A). Synchronous motors 25 HP to 200 HP at unity PF. Used for all three-phase motor calculations: conductor sizing (125% FLA), overload protection (115-125% FLA), branch circuit protection (Table 430.52). Most common industrial/commercial motors: pumps, fans, compressors, conveyors. 460V motors most common. Essential reference for electricians. Required by NEC 430.250 for 3-phase motor FLA.",
