cec-001	What are the panelboard space requirements for single-family dwellings in California? What appliances must have reserved circuit breaker spaces?

EXPECTED ANSWER: CEC 408.2(A) requires panelboards in single-family dwellings to have reserved spaces for branch circuits for: (1) heat pump water heaters, (2) heat pump space heaters, (3) electric cooktops, and (4) electric clothes dryers, as specified in California Energy Code Section 150.0(n), (t), (u), and (v). This is a California-specific requirement for electrification readiness. Note: EV charging requirements are separate and found in CEC Article 625 and Title 24 CALGreen, not in CEC 408.2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-002	What are California's electrical requirements for EV charging infrastructure in new residential construction?

EXPECTED ANSWER: California requires EV-ready infrastructure in new construction including dedicated 40-amp minimum circuits, conduit to parking spaces, and panel capacity for EV loads. These requirements are found in CEC Article 625 and Title 24 CALGreen (not CEC 408.2). Title 24 CALGreen mandates EV charging readiness with specific requirements for EV Capable, EV Ready, and installed EVCS spaces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-003	What are the California-specific electrical requirements for solar PV systems on new residential construction?

EXPECTED ANSWER: California mandates solar PV on new single-family homes (Title 24 Part 6). Electrical requirements include rapid shutdown per CEC 690.12, arc-fault protection per CEC 690.11, specific grounding requirements per 690.41-47, and multiple disconnecting means requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-004	What circuit requirements does California have for heat pump water heaters in new dwelling units?

EXPECTED ANSWER: Per CEC 408.2, panelboards must have a reserved space for a heat pump water heater branch circuit. This is part of California's decarbonization requirements to ensure electrical infrastructure can support heat pump water heaters as replacements for gas water heaters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-005	What is required for electric cooktop readiness in new California homes?

EXPECTED ANSWER: CEC 408.2 requires panelboards to have a reserved space for electric cooktop branch circuits. This ensures homes are ready for all-electric cooking appliances as part of California's building electrification requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-006	What are the panelboard requirements for electric clothes dryer circuits in California new construction?

EXPECTED ANSWER: CEC 408.2 requires panelboards to have a reserved space for electric clothes dryer branch circuits in single-family dwellings. This is a California-specific requirement for building electrification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-007	What does CEC Table 240.4(G) specify that is unique to California?

EXPECTED ANSWER: CEC Table 240.4(G) is a California-only table that provides additional overcurrent protection requirements. This table does not exist in the base NEC 2023.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-008	What does CEC Table 242.3 specify for California installations?

EXPECTED ANSWER: CEC Table 242.3 is a California-only table related to surge protection requirements. This table does not exist in the base NEC 2023.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-009	What does CEC Table 430.72(B) specify for motor control circuit overcurrent protection?

EXPECTED ANSWER: CEC Table 430.72(B) specifies maximum ratings of overcurrent protective devices for motor control circuits based on conductor size and configuration. It includes columns for separate protection, conductors within enclosure, and conductors extending beyond enclosure for both copper and aluminum conductors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-010	What medium voltage cable tables does California have that are not in the NEC?

EXPECTED ANSWER: CEC has 18 medium voltage tables in the 311.60(C) series (Tables 311.60(C)(67) through 311.60(C)(86)) that are California-only. These provide ampacity information for medium voltage cables not found in the base NEC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-026	Compare the kitchen GFCI requirements between CEC 2022 and NEC 2023. Which code is more restrictive?

EXPECTED ANSWER: CEC 2022 is MORE PERMISSIVE than NEC 2023 for kitchen GFCI. CEC limits GFCI requirements to receptacles serving countertop surfaces and within 6 feet of the sink. NEC 2023 requires GFCI protection for ALL kitchen receptacles, including those for refrigerators and built-in microwaves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-027	Compare the panelboard space requirements between CEC 2022 and NEC 2023 for single-family dwellings.

EXPECTED ANSWER: CEC 2022 Section 408.2(A) requires reserved panelboard spaces for: (1) heat pump water heaters, (2) heat pump space heaters, (3) electric cooktops, and (4) electric clothes dryers. NEC 2023 has NO such requirement. This is a significant California-specific difference for building electrification. Note: EV charging requirements are in CEC Article 625 and Title 24 CALGreen, not in CEC 408.2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-028	Compare California's EV charging infrastructure requirements with the NEC 2023 requirements.

EXPECTED ANSWER: California (CEC + Title 24) MANDATES EV charging infrastructure in new construction, requiring dedicated circuits, conduit, and panel capacity. NEC 2023 Article 625 only provides installation rules for EV charging equipment but does not mandate installation. California leads with proactive requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-029	Compare the AFCI protection requirements between CEC 2022 and NEC 2023 for dwelling units.

EXPECTED ANSWER: Both CEC 2022 and NEC 2023 require AFCI protection for 120V, 15/20A branch circuits in kitchens, family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, bedrooms, sunrooms, closets, hallways, laundry areas, and similar rooms. The requirements are largely similar between the two codes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cec-030	Compare California's solar PV requirements with NEC 2023 Article 690.

EXPECTED ANSWER: California MANDATES solar PV on new single-family homes through Title 24 Part 6. CEC 690 follows NEC 690 for installation requirements (rapid shutdown, arc-fault protection, grounding). The key difference is California requires solar installation; NEC only covers how to install it safely.
