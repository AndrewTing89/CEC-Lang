--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

core-011	Why does the NEC require AFCI protection for bedrooms and living areas? What electrical hazard does it prevent?

EXPECTED ANSWER: AFCI protection prevents electrical fires caused by arc faults. It detects arcing conditions that standard breakers cannot, including series arcing (broken/damaged wires), parallel arcing (line-to-line or line-to-ground), loose connections, damaged insulation, and deteriorated wire. Required per 210.12 for dwelling unit 120V, 15A and 20A branch circuits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

core-012	Why are torque specifications important when terminating conductors in a panel, and where are the requirements found?

EXPECTED ANSWER: Torque specifications prevent: (1) loose connections causing high resistance and heat generation (fire hazard), (2) poor contact leading to arcing, (3) overtightening causing crushed conductors or damaged terminals. Requirements found in 110.14(D) - must follow manufacturer specifications or Table 110.14(D). Also per 110.3(B) - follow manufacturer instructions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

inspection-001	Residential panel inspection: 200A main breaker. Installed loads: (1) 12kW electric range on 40A breaker, (2) 5.5kW dryer on 30A breaker, (3) two 20A small appliance circuits, (4) one 20A laundry circuit, (5) 3000 sq ft living space with general lighting, (6) 4-ton central AC (19.2A at 240V, approximately 4600W). Calculate the service load per NEC Article 220 and determine if the 200A panel is adequately sized. Show your work.

EXPECTED ANSWER: General lighting: 3000 sq ft × 3 VA = 9000 VA. Small appliance: 2 circuits × 1500 VA = 3000 VA. Laundry: 1500 VA. Subtotal: 13,500 VA. Apply demand factor per Table 220.42: first 3000 VA at 100% = 3000 VA, remaining 10,500 VA at 35% = 3675 VA. Subtotal with demand: 6675 VA. Range: 8000 VA (per Table 220.55 for one range). Dryer: 5500 VA at 100%. AC: 4600 VA at 100% (largest motor). Total: 6675 + 8000 + 5500 + 4600 = 24,775 VA. Current: 24,775 VA ÷ 240V = 103.2A. Conclusion: 200A service is adequately sized with 48% safety margin.

inspection-006	Subpanel inspection in detached garage: 100A subpanel fed from main house panel with 4-wire feeder (#2 AWG aluminum: 2 hots, 1 neutral, 1 ground). Inspector notes: (1) neutral bar and ground bar are bonded together with main bonding jumper installed, (2) ground bar is bonded to metal enclosure, (3) neutral bar is bonded to metal enclosure, (4) feeder ground wire is connected to ground bar, (5) feeder neutral is connected to neutral bar. Identify all violations and explain correct configuration.

EXPECTED ANSWER: VIOLATIONS: (1) Neutral bar bonded to enclosure - VIOLATION per 250.24(A)(5) and 408.40. In subpanels, neutral must be isolated from enclosure. (2) Main bonding jumper installed - VIOLATION. MBJ only permitted at service equipment per 250.28, not in subpanels. CORRECT configuration: Remove bond between neutral bar and enclosure. Remove main bonding jumper. Neutral bar must be isolated (floating). Only ground bar bonded to enclosure. Feeder EGC connects to ground bar. Feeder neutral connects to isolated neutral bar. Grounds and neutrals must be kept separate in subpanels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

inspection-007	A 1¼-inch rigid metal conduit (RMC) needs to accommodate multiple 10 AWG THHN conductors for a commercial installation. Using NEC Chapter 9 Tables, determine the maximum number of 10 AWG THHN conductors that can be installed in this conduit. Show your calculation.

EXPECTED ANSWER: Per Chapter 9 Table 1: Maximum 40% fill for more than two conductors. From Chapter 9 Table 4: Trade size 1¼" RMC has 40% fill area of 0.610 square inches. From Chapter 9 Table 5: 10 AWG THHN conductor area is 0.0211 square inches. Calculation: 0.610 in² ÷ 0.0211 in² per conductor = 28.91 conductors. Per Chapter 9 Note 7: When the decimal is 0.8 or larger, round up to the next whole number. Since 0.91 > 0.8, maximum is 29 conductors. However, conservative practice uses 28 conductors maximum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

inspection-008	A 120V single-phase branch circuit supplies a continuous load of 22 amperes. The circuit uses 12 AWG copper conductors with a resistance of 1.29 ohms per 1,000 feet. The one-way distance from the panel to the load is 50 feet. Calculate the voltage drop in volts and as a percentage. Does this meet NEC recommendations (3% maximum for branch circuits)?

EXPECTED ANSWER: Voltage drop formula: VD = (2 × L × R × I) / 1000. Where: L = 50 feet (one-way distance), R = 1.29 ohms/1000ft for 12 AWG copper (Chapter 9 Table 8), I = 22 amperes, multiply by 2 for round trip. Calculation: VD = (2 × 50 × 1.29 × 22) / 1000 = 2,838 / 1000 = 2.84 volts. Percentage: (2.84V / 120V) × 100 = 2.37%. Conclusion: YES, this meets NEC recommendations. 2.37% is less than the 3% maximum recommended for branch circuits per 210.19(A)(1) Informational Note No. 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

inspection-009	A conduit in an attic contains six 12 AWG TW (Type TW, 60°C rated) copper conductors, all current-carrying. The attic ambient temperature reaches 110°F (43°C). Calculate the adjusted ampacity of these conductors after applying both temperature correction and bundling adjustment factors. Show all steps.

EXPECTED ANSWER: Step 1: Base ampacity of 12 AWG TW copper at 60°C = 20 amperes (Table 310.16). Step 2: Temperature correction for 43°C ambient with 60°C conductor from Table 310.15(B)(1)(1): Correction factor = 0.71 (for 41-45°C range in 60°C column). Step 3: Bundling adjustment for 6 conductors from Table 310.15(C)(1): Adjustment factor = 0.80 (for 4-6 conductors). Step 4: Calculate adjusted ampacity: 20A × 0.71 × 0.80 = 11.36 amperes. Conclusion: The adjusted ampacity is 11.36 amperes (approximately 11.4A), which represents a 43% reduction from the base 20A rating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

inspection-010	A commercial data center has a main service with four parallel sets of 250 kcmil copper conductors per phase (total equivalent: 4 × 250 kcmil = 1000 kcmil per phase). Using NEC Table 250.66, determine the minimum size copper grounding electrode conductor (GEC) required for this installation.

EXPECTED ANSWER: Per Table 250.66: For service entrance conductors 1000 kcmil copper (4 × 250 kcmil in parallel), locate the row for 'Over 600 kcmil through 1100 kcmil'. The minimum grounding electrode conductor size is 2/0 AWG copper or 4/0 AWG aluminum. Answer: Minimum 2/0 AWG copper GEC required. Note: If this GEC connects solely to a ground rod electrode per 250.66(A), the GEC would not be required to be larger than 6 AWG copper.
