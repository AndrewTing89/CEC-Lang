The one-way distance from the panel to the load is 50 feet. Calculate the voltage drop in volts and as a percentage. Does this meet the 3% maximum recommendation for branch circuits?",

Where: L = 50 feet (one-way distance), R = 1.29 ohms/1000ft for 12 AWG copper (Chapter 9 Table 8), I = 22 amperes, multiply by 2 for round trip. Calculation: VD = (2 × 50 × 1.29 × 22) / 1000 = 2,838 / 1000 = 2.84 volts. Percentage: (2.84V / 120V) × 100 = 2.37%.
