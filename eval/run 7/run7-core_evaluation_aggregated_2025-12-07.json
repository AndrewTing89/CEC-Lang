This prevents parallel paths for fault currents and ensures proper operation of overcurrent devices at the main panel.\n\n2. **Grounding Electrode Conductor**  \n   - Install a **grounding electrode conductor** (sized per CEC Table 250.66 based on feeder conductor size) from the subpanel to a **local grounding electrode** (e.g., ground rod, concrete-encased electrode) at the garage.  \n   - Example: For a 100A feeder with 3/0 AWG aluminum conductors, use a **4 AWG copper** grounding electrode conductor (Table 250.66).  \n\n3. **Equipment Grounding Conductor (EGC)**  \n   - The 4th wire in the feeder (EGC) must be **continuously bonded** from the main panel to the subpanel. This ensures an effective fault current path back to the main service.  \n\n4. **Bonding of Metal Parts**  \n   - All metal parts of the subpanel (enclosure, raceways) must be **bonded** to the EGC (CEc 250.96). No nonconductive coatings (e.g., paint) should interfere with bonding connections.  \n\n5. **Grounding Electrode Requirement**  \n   - A local grounding electrode is **required** at the detached garage (CEC 250.58).

This creates a parallel ground path and risks improper ground-fault current flow.  \n   - **Exceptions Checked:** No exceptions apply here. Sections 250.25 and 250.54 relate to supply-side connections or auxiliary electrodes, not standard subpanels.  \n\n2. **Neutral Bar Bonded to Metal Enclosure**  \n   - **Violation:** CEC 250.142 prohibits bonding the neutral conductor to the metal enclosure in subpanels. This creates a parallel path for fault current, bypassing overcurrent devices.  \n   - **Exceptions Checked:** Exceptions in 250.80 and 250.86 apply to service raceways or short metal enclosures, not standard subpanel configurations.  \n\n3. **Ground Bar Bonded to Enclosure (Incorrect Method)**  \n   - **Violation:** While bonding the ground bar to the enclosure is correct, **this must comply with 250.8** (e.g., listed bonding means). If the bonding method violates 250.8 (e.g., poor connections), it’s a violation.  \n   - **Exceptions Checked:** Exceptions in 250.86(2) and 250.80 do not override the requirement for proper bonding methods.  \n\n---\n\n### **Correct Configuration for a Standard Subpanel (CEc_search + cec_exception_search):**\n1. **Neutral and Ground Separation**  \n   - **Neutral Bar:** Connect **only** the feeder neutral wire (from main panel).  \n   - **Ground Bar:** Connect **only** the feeder ground wire (from main panel) and all equipment grounding conductors (EGcs).  \n   - **No bonding** between neutral/ground bars or to the enclosure.  \n\n2. **Enclosure Bonding**  \n   - Bond the **ground bar** to the metal enclosure using a listed bonding jumper (e.g., green screw or clamp) per 250.8.  \n   - **Do not bond the neutral bar** to the enclosure.  \n\n3. **Feeder Connections**  \n   - Feeder neutral: Connected to neutral bar.  \n   - Feeder ground: Connected to ground bar.  \n   - Hot conductors: Connected to the main breaker or busbar.  \n\n4. **Grounding Conductor Size**  \n   - For a 100A subpanel with #2 AWG aluminum feeders, the **minimum grounding conductor** is **#6 AWG copper** or **#4 AWG aluminum** (CEc_lookup_grounding_conductor(\"equipment\", \"100\")).  \n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Comparison**  \n- **No difference** from NEC 2023 for standard subpanel bonding requirements.

For **copper service-entrance conductors**, Table 250.66 specifies the minimum grounding electrode conductor (GEC) size.\n2. For **1000 kcmil copper**, Table 250.66 requires a **3/0 AWG copper** GEC.\n\n**Key CEC Exceptions Checked:**\n- **250.66(A)-(C):** Allow smaller GEC sizes if conn"
