Reserved Circuit Breaker Spaces for Appliances**\n**California Requirement (CEC 2022 Section 408.2(A)):**\n- **Mandatory Reserved Spaces**: Panelboards in single-family dwellings must include pre-wired circuit breaker spaces for:\n  - Heat pump water heaters\n  - Heat pump space heaters\n  - Electric cooktops\n  - Electric clothes dryers  \n  *This is a California Energy Code mandate (Section 150.0(n), (t), (u), (v)).*\n\n**Exceptions Checked**:\n- No exceptions to **Section 408.2(A)** were found that would modify or remove this appliance-specific requirement.\n- Exceptions in related sections (e.g., 408.36, 408.38) address overcurrent protection and enclosures, not reserved spaces for appliances.\n\n---\n\n### **2. General Panelboard Requirements**\n- **Minimum Rating**: Panelboards must have a rating ≥ calculated feeder capacity (Section 408.30).\n- **Enclosure Type**: Must be \"dead-front\" (no live parts exposed on the front) unless accessible only to qualified personnel (Section 408.38).\n- **Wire-Bending Space**: Sized per Table 312.6(A)/(B), with exceptions for smaller panelboards (≤225A, ≤42 devices) (Section 408.55).\n\n---\n\n## NEC 2023 Reference\n- **Reserved Spaces**: **Not required** by NEC 2023. The appliance-specific reserved spaces are a **California amendment**.\n- **General Requirements**: NEC 2023 Sections 408.30, 408.38, and 408.55 align with CEC requirements for panelboard ratings, enclosures, and wire-bending spaces.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (California), NEC 2023 (reference)**",
