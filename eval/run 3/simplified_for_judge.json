    "question": "A 120V single-phase branch circuit supplies a continuous load of 22 amperes. The circuit uses 12 AWG copper conductors with a resistance of 1.29 ohms per 1,000 feet. The one-way distance from the panel to the load is 50 feet. Calculate the voltage drop in volts and as a percentage. Does this meet NEC recommendations (3% maximum for branch circuits)?",
    "expected_answer": "Voltage drop formula: VD = (2 × L × R × I) / 1000. Where: L = 50 feet (one-way distance), R = 1.29 ohms/1000ft for 12 AWG copper (Chapter 9 Table 8), I = 22 amperes, multiply by 2 for round trip. Calculation: VD = (2 × 50 × 1.29 × 22) / 1000 = 2,838 / 1000 = 2.84 volts. Percentage: (2.84V / 120V) × 100 = 2.37%.

    "expected_answer": "Step 1: Base ampacity of 12 AWG TW copper at 60°C = 20 amperes (Table 310.16).

Using NEC Table 250.66, determine the minimum size copper grounding electrode conductor (GEC) required for this installation.",

The minimum grounding electrode conductor size is 2/0 AWG copper or 4/0 AWG aluminum. Answer: Minimum 2/0 AWG copper GEC required. Note: If this GEC connects solely to a ground rod electrode per 250.66(A), the GEC would not be required to be larger than 6 AWG copper.",
    "answer": "## Minimum Size Copper Grounding Electrode Conductor (GEC) for 1000 kcmil Service Conductors\n\n**CEC 2022 Requirement:**  \nPer CEC Table 250.66, the grounding electrode conductor (GEC) for service conductors totaling **1000 kcmil** (four parallel 250 kcmil conductors) is sized based on the **next higher size** listed in the table. For service conductors up to 600 kcmil, the GEC is **1/0 AWG copper**. Since 1000 kcmil exceeds the table's listed sizes, the GEC remains **1/0 AWG copper** (per the \"next higher size\" rule in NEC/CEC 250.66).\n\n**Exceptions Considered:**  \n- **Exception 250.66(A)**: If connected to rod, pipe, or plate electrodes, the GEC could be reduced to **6 AWG copper** if it does not extend to other electrode types. However, this applies only to specific electrode types and is not the general rule.  \n- **Exception 250.66(B)**: For concrete-encased electrodes, the GEC could be **4 AWG copper**, but this is also electrode-specific.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe minimum size copper GEC required is **1/0 AWG** for 1000 kcmil service conductors under CEC 2022 Table 250.66.  \n\n---\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \nNo difference from NEC 2023.
