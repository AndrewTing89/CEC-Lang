      "accuracy_notes": "Model calculates 2.56V (2.13%) but then shows calculation arriving at 2.58V (2.15%). Expected answer is 2.84V (2.37%). The discrepancy is in the current used: Model uses 20A or 22A in different parts of answer, but then states 'We will use 22A for the calculation.' Expected formula: VD = (2 × 50 × 1.29 × 22) / 1000 = 2,838/1000 = 2.84V. Model's calculation: 22A × 0.129Ω = 2.58V. The model correctly calculates R_total = 100ft/1000 × 1.29 = 0.129Ω. Then 22A × 0.129Ω = 2.838V ≈ 2.84V. So model should get correct answer. The issue is model shows both 20A and 22A calculations and gets confused. The 2.58V appears to use ~20A.",
