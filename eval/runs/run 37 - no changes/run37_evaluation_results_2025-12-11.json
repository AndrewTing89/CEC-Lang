Insufficient Working Space Depth**  \n- **Violation**: Panel has **28 inches** of depth clearance in front, but **36 inches (3 ft)** is required for 120V equipment under **Condition 1** (Table 110.26(A)(1)).  \n- **Citation**: CEC 2022 Table 110.26(A)(1)  \n- **Impact**: Workers cannot safely access the panel for servicing.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Obstruction in Working Space**  \n- **Violation**: Water heater located **16 inches** to the left of the panel intrudes into the required **3 ft (36 in)** working space.  \n- **Citation**: CEC 2022 Section 110.26(B) (\"Working space shall not be used for storage or obstructions\").  \n- **Impact**: Creates a hazard by limiting access and increasing risk of accidental contact.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Vertical Clearance Issue**  \n- **Violation**: Panel is mounted at **5 ft height**, but **6.5 ft (78 in)** of vertical clearance is required above the floor in the working space (Section 110.26(A)(2)).  \n- **Citation**: CEC 2022 Section 110.26(A)(2)  \n- **Note**: If the ceiling height is less than 6.5 ft above the floor, this violates the code. The question does not specify ceiling height, so this violation is **conditional**.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Panel Location Compliance**  \n- **No Violation Identified**: The question does not indicate the panel is in a prohibited location (e.g., clothes closet, bathroom). **Section 240.24(D)** prohibits panels near easily ignitable materials (e.g., clothes closets), but this is not mentioned in the scenario.  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Required Corrections**  \n1. **Increase depth clearance** to **36 inches** in front of the panel.  \n2. **Relocate the water heater** to eliminate obstruction within the working space.  \n3. **Verify ceiling height** to ensure **6.5 ft of vertical clearance** above the floor.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

There shall be no more than six overcurrent devices grouped in any one location.\n\n- (3) Overcurrent relaying is connected [with a current transformer(s), if needed] to sense all of the secondary conductor current and limit the load to the conductor ampacity by opening upstream or downstream devices.\n\n- (4) Conductors shall be considered to be protected if calculations, made under engineering supervision, determine that the system overcurrent devices will protect the conductors from overload conditions.\n\n\n- (3) Physical Protection. The secondary conductors are protected from physical damage by being enclosed in an approved raceway or by other approved means.\n\n\n##### (D) Outside Feeder Taps. Outside conductors shall be permitted to be tapped to a feeder or to be connected at a transformer secondary, without overcurrent protection at the tap or connection, where all the following conditions are met:\n\n\n- (1) The conductors are protected from physical damage in an approved manner.\n\n- (2) The sum of the overcurrent devices at the conductor termination limits the load to the conductor ampacity. The overcurrent devices shall consist of not more than six circuit breakers or sets of fuses mounted in a single enclosure,\n\n\n- in a group of separate enclosures, or in or on a switchboard or switchgear. There shall be no more than six overcurrent devices grouped in any one location.\n- (3) The tap conductors are installed outdoors of a building or structure except at the point of load termination.\n\n- (4) The overcurrent device for the conductors is an integral part of a disconnecting means or is located immediately adjacent thereto.\n\n- (5) The disconnecting means for the conductors are installed at a readily accessible location complying with one of the following:\n\n- a. Outside of a building or structure\n- b. Inside, nearest the point of entrance of the conductors\n- c. Where installed in accordance with 230.6, nearest the point of entrance of the conductors\n\n##### (E) Protection by Primary Overcurrent Device. Conductors supplied by the secondary side of a transformer shall be permitted to be protected by overcurrent protection provided on the primary (supply) side of the transformer, provided the primary device time-current protection characteristic, multiplied by the maximum effective primary-to-secondary transformer voltage ratio, effectively protects the secondary conductors.\n\n\n============================================================\n[AUTO-INJECTED CROSS-REFERENCES - These sections were referenced above]\n============================================================\n### Referenced Section 695.14\n#### 695.14  Control Wiring.\n(A)  Control Circuit Failures.

This creates parallel paths for fault currents and violates the single-point bonding requirement.  \n\n2. **Neutral Bar Bonded to Metal Enclosure**  \n   - **Violation**: 250.24(D) and 250.32(B)(1) require the neutral (grounded) conductor to be isolated from the equipment grounding system in subpanels.  \n   - **Issue**: Bonding the neutral bar to the enclosure creates an unintended path for fault currents and violates the separation of neutral and ground in separately derived systems (subpanels).  \n\n3. **Missing Grounding Electrode Conductor (GEC)**  \n   - **Violation**: 250.32(B)(1) mandates a grounding electrode conductor for all buildings/structures supplied by feeders.  \n   - **Issue**: No GEC is mentioned connecting the subpanel’s grounding system to a local grounding electrode (e.g., ground rod).  \n\n---\n\n### **Correct Configuration**\n1. **Neutral and Ground Bars**  \n   - **Neutral Bar**: Connected only to the feeder neutral conductor.  \n   - **Ground Bar**: Connected to the feeder equipment grounding conductor and bonded to the subpanel enclosure.  \n   - **Isolation**: Neutral and ground bars must be physically separated (no bonding jumper).  \n\n2. **Grounding Electrode Conductor (GEC)**  \n   - **Size**: Per Table 250.66, for #2 AWG aluminum feeders:  \n     - **Copper**: 6 AWG (CEC Table 250.66).  \n     - **Aluminum**: 4 AWG (CEC Table 250.66).  \n   - **Connection**: Run from the ground bar to a local grounding electrode (e.g., 8 ft ground rod).  \n\n3. **Equipment Grounding Conductor**  \n   - **Size**: Per Table 250.122 for 100A subpanel:  \n     - **Copper**: 8 AWG (CEC Table 250.122).  \n     - **Aluminum**: 6 AWG (CEC Table 250.122).  \n   - **Connection**: Connect the feeder ground conductor to the ground bar (not the neutral bar).  \n\n4. **Enclosure Bonding**  \n   - The ground bar must be bonded to the subpanel enclosure (per 250.32(B)(1)), but the neutral bar must remain isolated.  \n\n---\n\n### **Inspector Notes**\n- **Violation 1**: Remove the main bonding jumper between neutral and ground bars.  \n- **Violation 2**: Disconnect the neutral bar from the enclosure.  \n- **Violation 3**: Install a GEC (6 AWG copper or 4 AWG aluminum) from the ground bar to a grounding electrode.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Sections 250.24, 250.32, Table 250.66, Table 250.122",

Below are the key California-specific medium voltage cable tables and their applications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Medium Voltage Cable Ampacity Tables**\nThese tables determine the allowable current-carrying capacity (ampacity) for Type MV cables (2001–35,000 volts nominal):\n\n#### **Table 311.60(C)(75) & 311.60(C)(76)**  \n- **Application**: Multiconductor MV cables in cable trays.  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - 95% of listed ampacities permitted if cable trays are continuously covered with solid unventilated covers for >1.8 m (6 ft).  \n  - Ampacities adjusted for spacing and environmental factors (e.g., ambient temperature).  \n\n#### **Table 311.60(C)(69) & 311.60(C)(70)**  \n- **Application**: Single-conductor MV cables in cable trays.  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - 75% of ampacities for uncovered trays; 70% if trays are covered >1.8 m (6 ft).  \n  - Adjustments for conductor size (≥1/0 AWG) and configuration (e.g., triangular/triplexed).  \n\n#### **Table 311.60(C)(67) & 311.60(C)(68)**  \n- **Application**: Single-conductor MV cables in triangular/square configurations.  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - Ampacities based on spacing (≥2.15× conductor diameter) and free air circulation.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Cable Tray Installation Tables**\nThese tables govern the physical installation of MV cables in cable trays, including fill limits and spacing:\n\n#### **Table 392.22(A) & 392.22(B)**  \n- **Application**: Fill limits for multiconductor and single-conductor cables in ladder, ventilated trough, or solid bottom trays.  \n- **Key Provisions**:  \n  - Maximum allowable fill area based on cable size and tray width.  \n  - Special rules for 4/0 AWG or larger cables (single-layer installation).  \n\n#### **Table 392.22(A)(5) & 392.22(A)(6)**  \n- **Application**: Ventilated and solid channel cable trays.  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - Cross-sectional area limits for multiconductor cables.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. General MV Cable Requirements**\n- **Section 311.1**: Scope covers Type MV cables (2001–35,000 volts nominal).  \n- **Section 311.60**: Requires engineering supervision or use of listed tables for ampacity determination.  \n- **Section 392.80(B)**: Ampacity adjustments for MV cables in trays (e.g., 75% for 600 kcmil+ cables in uncovered trays).  \n\n---\n\n### **California-Specific Notes**\n- **Title 24 Compliance**: California mandates additional energy efficiency and safety provisions for MV systems, including derating factors for environmental conditions.  \n- **CALGreen Requirements**: May impose stricter guidelines for cable insulation materials and fire resistance in certain applications.  \n\n---\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 (Incorporates NEC with California amendments).",

See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 9 [CEC 2022 Section 392.22(A)] (relevance: 0.32)\n##### (A) Number of Multiconductor Cables, Rated 2000 Volts or Less, in Cable Trays.

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 3 [CEC 2022 Section 330.112] (relevance: 0.45)\n#### 330.112 Insulation\n\nInsulated conductors shall comply with 330.112(A) or (B).\n\n##### (A) 1000 Volts or Less.
