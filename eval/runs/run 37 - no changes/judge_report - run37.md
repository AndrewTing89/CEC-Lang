## Detailed Results

### cec2022-001
**Question:** What is the ampacity of 12 AWG copper conductor at 75°C termination?

**Agent Answer:** 12 AWG copper at 75°C termination has a base ampacity of **25 amperes** per Table 310.16. However, 240.4(D) limits overcurrent protection to **20A maximum** despite its 25A ampacity...

**Expected Answer:** 20 amperes

**Score:** 9/10 (Accuracy: 4/5, Completeness: 5/5)
**Accuracy Notes:** The agent correctly identifies that Table 310.16 shows 25A ampacity for 12 AWG copper at 75°C. The expected answer of "20 amperes" is the overcurrent protection limit from 240.4(D), not the ampacity. Agent is technically more accurate but may confuse users expecting the simplified answer.
**Completeness Notes:** Excellent - provides both the table ampacity and the practical OCP limitation.

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Table Lookups**: Near-perfect accuracy on all table-based questions (ampacity, derating, grounding)
2. **Calculations**: All derating and voltage drop calculations performed correctly
3. **California-specific knowledge**: Good identification of California amendments and unique tables
4. **Code citations**: Excellent use of proper section references throughout

### Areas for Improvement
1. **AFCI Requirements (cec2022-023)**: Critical miss - agent incorrectly stated AFCI only applies to bedrooms when CEC 2022 210.12 requires AFCI for ALL 120V 15/20A dwelling circuits including kitchens
2. **Enclosure Types (cec2022-045)**: Minor omissions in the enclosure type list (missed Type 3 and 3R)
3. **Medium Voltage Tables (cec2022-038)**: Didn't provide complete count of 20 tables

### Run 37 vs Run 36 Comparison
- Both runs show similar patterns of errors
- cec2022-023 (AFCI for kitchen) remains a persistent issue
- Overall accuracy remains high at 96%
