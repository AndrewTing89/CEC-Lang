The calculated load shall be the result of adding the loads from 220.82(B) and (C). Feeder and serviceentrance conductors whose calculated load is determined by this optional calculation shall be permitted to have the neutral load determined by 220.61.\n\n\nTable 220.55 Demand Factors and Loads for Household Electric Ranges, Wall-Mounted Ovens, Counter-Mounted Cooking Units, and Other Household Cooking Appliances over 1 3 /4 kW Rating (Column C to be used in all cases except as otherwise permitted in Note 3.)\n\n\n## Notes:\n\n1. Over 12 kW through 27 kW ranges all of same rating. For ranges individually rated more than 12 kW but not more than 27 kW, the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each additional kilowatt of rating or major fraction thereof by which the rating of individual ranges exceeds 12 kW.\n\n2. Over 8 3 /4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.\n\n4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.\n\n5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 1 3 /4 kW and used in instructional programs.\n\nTable 220.56 Demand Factors for Kitchen Equipment - Other Than Dwelling Unit(s)\n\n\n##### (B) General Loads. The general calculated load shall be not less than 100 percent of the first 10 kV A plus 40 percent of the remainder of the following loads:\n\n\n- (1) 33 volt-amperes/m 2 or 3 volt-amperes/ft 2 for general lighting and general-use receptacles. The floor area for each floor shall be calculated from the outside dimensions of the dwelling unit. The calculated floor area shall not include open porches, garages, or unused or unfinished spaces not adaptable for future use.\n\n- (2) 1500  volt-amperes for each 2-wire, 20-ampere smallappliance branch circuit and each laundry branch circuit covered in 210.11(C)(1) and (C)(2).\n\n- (3) The nameplate rating of the following:\n\n- a. All appliances that are fastened in place, permanently connected, or located to be on a specific circuit\n- b. Ranges, wall-mounted ovens, counter-mounted cooking units\n- c. Clothes dryers that are not connected to the laundry branch circuit specified in item (2)\n- d. Water heaters\n- (4) The nameplate ampere or kVA rating of all permanently connected motors not included in item (3).\n\n\n##### (C) Heating and Air-Conditioning Load. The largest of the following six selections (load in kV A) shall be included:\n\n\n- (1) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the air conditioning and cooling.\n\n- (2) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump when the heat pump is used without any supplemental electric heating.\n\n- (3) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump compressor and 65 percent of the supplemental electric heating for central electric space-heating systems. If the heat pump compressor is prevented from operating at the same time as the supplementary heat, it does not need to be added to the supplementary heat for the total central space heating load.\n\n- (4) 65 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if less than four separately controlled units.\n\n- (5) 40 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if four or more separately controlled units.\n\n- (6) 100  percent of the nameplate ratings of electric thermal storage and other heating systems where the usual load is\n\n\nexpected to be continuous at the full nameplate value. Systems qualifying under this selection shall not be calculated under any other selection in 220.82(C).\n\nResult 5 [CEC 2022 Section 220.40] (relevance: 9.79)\n#### 220.40 General\n\nThe calculated load of a feeder or service shall not be less than the sum of the loads on the branch circuits supplied, as determined by Part II of this article, after any applicable demand factors permitted by Part III or IV or required by Part V have been applied.\n\nInformational Note: See Examples D1(a) through D10 in Informative Annex D.

No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

Sealants shall be identified for use with cable insulation, conductor insulation, a bare conductor, a shield, or other components. An explosionproof seal shall not be required for this purpose.\n\n\n##### (B) Expansion, Expansion-Deflection, and Deflection Fittings. Raceways shall be provided with expansion, expansiondeflection, or deflection fittings where necessary to compensate for thermal expansion, deflection, and contraction.\n\n\nInformational Note: Table 352.44 and Table 355.44 provide the expansion information for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and for reinforced thermosetting resin conduit (RTRC), respectively. A nominal number for steel conduit can be determined by multiplying the expansion length in Table 352.44 by 0.20.

      "answer": "## Panel Location in Closet (CEC 2022)\n\n**Answer:**  \nNo, this does **not** meet code requirements.  \n\n**Key Code Provisions:**  \n1. **CEC 240.24(D)** explicitly prohibits overcurrent devices (panels) from being located in the vicinity of easily ignitible material, such as **clothes closets**.  \n2. **CEC 240.24(E)** further prohibits panels in bathrooms of dwelling units, but the critical issue here is the closet location.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n- While the panel has 24 inches of front clearance (meeting working space requirements in **110.26**), **Section 240.24(D)** directly prohibits panel installation in clothes closets regardless of clearance.  \n- The presence of stored clothing (easily ignitible material) in the closet creates a fire hazard if the panel is located there.  \n- The water heater's 18-inch side clearance is irrelevant to the panel's compliance, as the code focuses on the **closet location** itself.  \n\n**Inspector Note:**  \nEven if clearances are adequate, panels must **never** be installed in clothes closets. Relocate the panel to a non-storage area per **240.24(D)**.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

      "answer": "## AFCI Protection Requirements (CEC 2022)\n\n**Answer:**  \nAFCI (Arc-Fault Circuit-Interrupter) protection is required for 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits in dwelling unit bedrooms, living areas, and similar spaces **to prevent electrical fires caused by arc faults**.  \n\n### Key Code Requirements:\n1. **Scope**:  \n   - **CEC 210.12(A)** mandates AFCI protection for all 120V, single-phase circuits supplying outlets in **bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and other habitable spaces** in dwelling units.  \n   - Exceptions apply for circuits dedicated to fire alarm systems (per 760.41(B)/760.121(B)) or specific industrial applications.\n\n2. **Hazard Prevented**:  \n   - **Arc faults** occur when damaged or loose wiring creates high-resistance connections, generating heat that can ignite surrounding materials.  \n   - AFCIs detect these arcs (unlike standard breakers, which only respond to overcurrents) and de-energize the circuit to prevent fires.  \n\n3. **Installation Methods**:  \n   - Options include **combination-type AFCIs** (protect against series and parallel arcs) or **outlet branch-circuit-type AFCIs** installed at the first outlet, as detailed in 210.12(A)(1)–(6).  \n\n4. **Code Rationale**:  \n   - The **Informational Notes** reference **UL 1699** (AFCI standards) and **NFPA 72** (fire alarm codes), emphasizing AFCIs' role in fire prevention.  \n\n**Inspector Note**: AFCI requirements apply to **new construction and modifications** (per 210.12(D)). Ensure compliance with listed installation methods and marking requirements (e.g., identifying first-outlet locations).  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Sections 210.12, 100",

Ensure compliance with listed installation methods and marking requirements (e.g., identifying first-outlet locations).  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Sections 210.12, 100",

Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 9 [CEC 2022 Section 392.22(A)] (relevance: 0.32)\n##### (A) Number of Multiconductor Cables, Rated 2000 Volts or Less, in Cable Trays.

N\n\n- (1) Grounded Shields. Ampacities shown in Table 311.60(C)(69), Table 311.60(C)(70), Table 311.60(C)(81), and Table 311.60(C)(82) shall apply for cables with shields grounded at one point only. Where shields for these cables are grounded at more than one point, ampacities shall be adjusted to take into consideration the heating due to shield currents.\n\n\nInformational Note: Tables other than those listed contain the ampacity of cables with shields grounded at multiple points.\n\n- (2) Burial Depth. Where the burial depth of direct burial or electrical duct bank circuits is modified from the values shown in a figure or table, ampacities shall be permitted to be modified as indicated in 311.60(D)(2)(a) and (D)(2)(b). No ampacity adjustments shall be required where the burial depth is decreased. ∆\n\n\n(a) Where burial depths are increased in part(s) of an electrical duct run, a decrease in ampacity of the conductors shall not be required, provided the total length of parts of the duct run increased in depth is less than 25 percent of the total run length.\n\n(b) Where burial depths are deeper than shown in a specific underground ampacity table or figure, an ampacity derating factor of 6 percent per 300 mm (1 ft) increase in depth for all values of rho shall be permitted.\n\n- (3) Electrical Ducts Entering Equipment Enclosures. At locations where electrical ducts enter equipment enclosures from underground, spacing between such ducts, as shown in Figure 311.60(D)(3), shall be permitted to be reduced without requiring the ampacity of conductors therein to be reduced.\n\n\n- (4) Ambient Temperature Correction. Ampacities for ambient temperatures other than those specified in the ampacity tables shall be corrected in accordance with Table 311.60(D)(4) or shall be permitted to be calculated using the following equation:\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nI ′ = ampacity corrected for ambient temperature\n\nTc = temperature rating of conductor (°C)\n\nI = ampacity shown in the table for Tc and Ta\n\nT a ′ = new ambient temperature (°C)\n\nTa = ambient temperature used in the table (°C)\n\n\n============================================================\n[REFERENCED TABLE DATA - Use these exact values]\n============================================================\n### Table 310.4(A): Conductor Applications and Insulations Rated 600 Volts\ntype | max_temp | size | trade_name | application | insulation | mm | mils\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nFEP or FEPB | 90°C (194°F) | 14–10 | Fluorinated ethylene propylene | Dry and damp locations | Fluorinated ethylene propylene | 0.51 | 20\nFEP or FEPB | 90°C (194°F) | 8–2 | Fluorinated ethylene propylene | Dry and damp locations | Fluorinated ethylene propylene | 0.76 | 30\nFEP or FEPB | 200°C (392°F) | 14–8 | Fluorinated ethylene propylene | Dry locations — special applic | Fluorinated ethylene propylene | 0.36 | 14\nFEP or FEPB | 200°C (392°F) | 6–2 | Fluorinated ethylene propylene | Dry locations — special applic | Fluorinated ethylene propylene | 0.36 | 14\nMI | 90°C (194°F) | 18–16⁴ | Mineral insulation (metal shea | Dry and wet locations | Magnesium oxide | 0.58 | 23\nMI | 250°C (482°F) | 16–10 | Mineral insulation (metal shea | For special applications³ | Magnesium oxide | 0.91 | 36\nMI | 250°C (482°F) | 9–4 | Mineral insulation (metal shea | For special applications³ | Magnesium oxide | 1.27 | 50\nMI | 250°C (482°F) | 3–500 | Mineral insulation (metal shea | For special applications³ | Magnesium oxide | 1.40 | 55\nMTW | 60°C (140°F) | 22–12 | Moisture-, heat-, and oil-resi | Machine tool wiring in wet loc | Flame-retardant, moisture-, he |  | \nMTW | 90°C (194°F) | 10 | Moisture-, heat-, and oil-resi | Machine tool wiring in dry loc | Flame-retardant, moisture-, he |  | \nMTW | 90°C (194°F) | 8 | Moisture-, heat-, and oil-resi | Machine tool wiring in dry loc | Flame-retardant, moisture-, he |  | \nMTW | 90°C (194°F) | 6 | Moisture-, heat-, and oil-resi | Machine tool wiring in dry loc | Flame-retardant, moisture-, he |  | \nMTW | 90°C (194°F) | 4–2 | Moisture-, heat-, and oil-resi | Machine tool wiring in dry loc | Flame-retardant, moisture-, he |  | \nMTW | 90°C (194°F) | 1–4/0 | Moisture-, heat-, and oil-resi | Machine tool wiring in dry loc | Flame-retardant, moisture-, he |  | \nMTW | 90°C (194°F) | 213–500 | Moisture-, heat-, and oil-resi | Machine tool wiring in dry loc | Flame-retardant, moisture-, he |  | \n\n**Footnotes:**\n  [1] Conductors shall be permitted to be rated up to 1000 volts if listed and marked.\n  [2] Outer coverings shall not be required where listed without a covering.\n  [3] Higher temperature rated constructions shall be permitted where design conditions require maximum conductor operating temperatures above 90°C (194°F).\n  [4] Conductor sizes shall be permitted for signaling circuits permitting 300-volt insulation.\n  [5] The ampacity of Type UF cable shall be limited in accordance with 340.80.\n\n============================================================\n[AUTO-INJECTED CROSS-REFERENCES - These sections were referenced above]\n============================================================\n### Referenced Section 695.14\n#### 695.14  Control Wiring.\n(A)  Control Circuit Failures.
