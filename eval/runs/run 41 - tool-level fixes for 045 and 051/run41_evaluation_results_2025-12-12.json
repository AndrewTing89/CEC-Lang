      "answer": "## AFCI and GFCI Protection for Bedroom Circuits (CEC 2022)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n- **AFCI Protection**: **Required** for all 120V, 15/20A bedroom circuits per **CEC 210.12(A)**.  \n- **GFCI Protection**: **Not required** for standard bedroom receptacles (per **CEC 210.8** does not list bedrooms as GFCI-required locations).  \n\n---\n\n### **AFCI Requirements (CEC 210.12(A))**  \n- **Applies to**: All 120V, 15/20A circuits in dwelling units, including **bedrooms, living rooms, hallways, etc.**  \n- **Permitted Methods**:  \n  1. Combination-type AFCI at the circuit origin.  \n  2. Branch/feeder + outlet AFCI (with marking at first outlet).  \n  3. Supplemental arc protection + outlet AFCI (limited conductor lengths).  \n  4. Outlet AFCI + branch-circuit OCPD (limited conductor lengths).  \n  5. Outlet AFCI with metal raceway/conduit.  \n  6. Outlet AFCI with concrete-encased wiring.  \n- **Exception**: Fire alarm systems (not applicable to general bedroom circuits).  \n\n---\n\n### **GFCI Requirements (CEC 210.8)**  \n- **GFCI is NOT required** for standard bedroom receptacles.  \n- **GFCI is required** in these locations (not typically in bedrooms):  \n  - Bathrooms  \n  - Garages/outdoors  \n  - Kitchens (countertops)  \n  - Sinks (within 6 ft)  \n  - Crawlspaces/basements  \n  - Laundry areas  \n\n---\n\n### **Inspector Note**  \n- **AFCI vs. GFCI**:  \n  - **AFCI** prevents fires from arcing faults (required in bedrooms).  \n  - **GFCI** prevents shocks from ground faults (required in wet/damp locations).  \n- **Compliance**: Ensure AFCI protection is installed per 210.12(A) methods. GFCI is unnecessary for standard bedroom circuits unless receptacles are in a GFCI-mandated location (e.g., a bathroom within the bedroom).  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

      "answer": "## Aluminum Conductors for 200A Service (CEC 2022)\n\n**Answer:**  \nYes, aluminum conductors can be used for a 200A service. The required size is **250 kcmil aluminum** at 75°C, based on Table 310.16 ampacity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n1. **Material Permissibility:**  \n   - **CEC 2022 Section 310.3(B)** explicitly allows aluminum conductors for service applications.  \n   - **CEC 2022 Section 230.31(B)** specifies a minimum size of 6 AWG aluminum for underground service conductors, but this does not limit overhead or other installations.\n\n2. **Ampacity Determination:**  \n   - **Table 310.16** (General Use Ampacity) is used for sizing service conductors.  \n   - For **200A**, the minimum aluminum conductor size with a 75°C termination rating is **250 kcmil** (200A at 75°C).  \n\n3. **Termination Temperature Compliance:**  \n   - **Section 110.14(C)** requires conductors to be sized based on the lowest termination temperature rating (typically 75°C for service equipment).  \n   - 250 kcmil aluminum at 75°C provides **200A ampacity**, matching the 200A service requirement.\n\n4. **Overcurrent Protection Compliance:**  \n   - **Section 240.4(D)** allows 200A overcurrent protection for 250 kcmil aluminum (ampacity = 200A).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**  \n- **Conductor Material:** Aluminum (permitted by 310.3(B))  \n- **Size:** 250 kcmil aluminum (200A at 75°C, Table 310.16)  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

For ranges individually rated more than 12 kW but not more than 27 kW, the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each additional kilowatt of rating or major fraction thereof by which the rating of individual ranges exceeds 12 kW.\n\n2. Over 8 3 /4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.\n\n4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.\n\n5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 1 3 /4 kW and used in instructional programs.\n\nTable 220.56 Demand Factors for Kitchen Equipment - Other Than Dwelling Unit(s)\n\n\n##### (B) General Loads. The general calculated load shall be not less than 100 percent of the first 10 kV A plus 40 percent of the remainder of the following loads:\n\n\n- (1) 33 volt-amperes/m 2 or 3 volt-amperes/ft 2 for general lighting and general-use receptacles. The floor area for each floor shall be calculated from the outside dimensions of the dwelling unit. The calculated floor area shall not include open porches, garages, or unused or unfinished spaces not adaptable for future use.\n\n- (2) 1500  volt-amperes for each 2-wire, 20-ampere smallappliance branch circuit and each laundry branch circuit covered in 210.11(C)(1) and (C)(2).\n\n- (3) The nameplate rating of the following:\n\n- a. All appliances that are fastened in place, permanently connected, or located to be on a specific circuit\n- b. Ranges, wall-mounted ovens, counter-mounted cooking units\n- c. Clothes dryers that are not connected to the laundry branch circuit specified in item (2)\n- d. Water heaters\n- (4) The nameplate ampere or kVA rating of all permanently connected motors not included in item (3).\n\n\n##### (C) Heating and Air-Conditioning Load. The largest of the following six selections (load in kV A) shall be included:\n\n\n- (1) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the air conditioning and cooling.\n\n- (2) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump when the heat pump is used without any supplemental electric heating.\n\n- (3) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump compressor and 65 percent of the supplemental electric heating for central electric space-heating systems. If the heat pump compressor is prevented from operating at the same time as the supplementary heat, it does not need to be added to the supplementary heat for the total central space heating load.\n\n- (4) 65 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if less than four separately controlled units.\n\n- (5) 40 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if four or more separately controlled units.\n\n- (6) 100  percent of the nameplate ratings of electric thermal storage and other heating systems where the usual load is\n\n\nexpected to be continuous at the full nameplate value. Systems qualifying under this selection shall not be calculated under any other selection in 220.82(C).\n\n\n============================================================\n[REFERENCED TABLE DATA - Use these exact values]\n============================================================\n### Table 220.102: Method for Calculating Farm Loads for Other Than Dwelling Unit\nrow_label | values\n--- | ---\nThe greater of the following:  | Demand Factor (%): 100\n125 percent of the full load c | Demand Factor (%): \nFirst 60 amperes of the load | Demand Factor (%): \nNext 60 amperes of all other l | Demand Factor (%): 50\nRemainder of other loads | Demand Factor (%): 25",

      "answer": "## Multiwire Branch Circuit Requirements (CEC 2022)\n\n### Circuit Breaker Requirements\n1. **Simultaneous Disconnection**  \n   - **Section 210.4(B)**: The disconnecting means (breaker) must **simultaneously disconnect all ungrounded (hot) conductors**.  \n   - **Implementation**: Use a **2-pole breaker** or **handle-tied single-pole breakers** to ensure both hot conductors are disconnected together. This prevents the neutral from carrying unbalanced current if only one hot is disconnected.\n\n2. **Phase Configuration**  \n   - The two hot conductors must be connected to **opposite phases (legs)** of the panel. This ensures neutral current cancellation (per standard electrical practice, though not explicitly stated in CEC 2022).\n\n---\n\n### Neutral Termination Requirements\n1. **Grouping Conductors**  \n   - **Section 210.4(D)**: All conductors (hot, neutral, and ground) of the multiwire branch circuit must be **grouped together** (e.g., in the same cable or raceway).  \n   - **12/3 Cable Compliance**: The 12/3 cable (two hots, one neutral, one ground) satisfies this requirement by design.\n\n2. **Neutral Load Capacity**  \n   - The neutral conductor must be sized to carry the **maximum unbalanced load** (per standard practice). For 12 AWG copper conductors, the neutral is also 12 AWG, which is appropriate for a 20A circuit.\n\n3. **No Overloading**  \n   - The neutral must **not be shared** with other circuits unless they are part of the same multiwire branch circuit (per **Section 210.4(C)**). Overloading the neutral can cause overheating.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Requirements\n- **Line-to-Neutral Loads Only** (Section 210.4(C)):  \n  The circuit must supply only line-to-neutral loads (e.g., 120V receptacles). This applies to kitchen receptacles.\n- **No Exceptions for Kitchens**:  \n  Exceptions in 210.4(C) (e.g., single utilization equipment) do not apply here, as the circuit serves multiple receptacles.\n\n---\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Connecting two 12 AWG conductors to a single 20A breaker terminal **without the terminal being explicitly marked for two conductors** violates **CEC 2022 Section 110.3(B)** (Equipment Approval).  \n\n### Key Code Requirements:\n1. **Terminal Rating**  \n   - Per **110.3(B)**, equipment must be installed and used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and listing. If the breaker terminal is **not marked for two conductors**, it is not listed for this application.  \n   - Example: Most standard 20A breaker terminals are rated for **one conductor only** unless explicitly marked (e.g., \"2-wire\" or \"2-conductor\").\n\n2. **Ampacity Compliance**  \n   - While 12 AWG copper is rated for 20A (per **Table 310.16**), the **terminal's physical rating** (not just the conductor's ampacity) must also be considered. Overloading a terminal with multiple conductors can cause overheating if not designed for it.\n\n3. **NEC/CEC Basis**  \n   - This aligns with **NEC 110.3(B)** and **NEC 240.5(B)** (adopted in CEC), which require overcurrent devices to be used per their listing. Using a terminal beyond its rated capacity is prohibited.\n\n---\n\n### Inspector Action:\n- **Corrective Measure**: Replace the breaker with one explicitly marked for two conductors (e.g., \"2-wire\" terminal) or use a **junction box** to combine the conductors before connecting to a single conductor.  \n- **Penalty**: This is a **major violation** (e.g., \"stop work\" item) due to fire risk from terminal overheating.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 (based on NEC 110.3(B) and 240.5(B))",

This requirement applies to circuits that power general lighting, receptacles, and permanently wired devices in these spaces.\n\n**Electrical Hazard Prevented:**  \nAFCI (Arc-Fault Circuit-Interrupter) protection is required to **prevent electrical fires caused by dangerous arc faults**. Arc faults occur when electrical current leaks through damaged or deteriorated wiring, loose connections, or other faults. These arcs can ignite surrounding materials (e.g., wood, insulation, fabric), leading to structure fires. Bedrooms and living areas are high-risk locations because they contain many electrical devices, furniture, and materials that can fuel fires if an arc occurs.\n\n**Key Code Language from CEC 2022 Section 210.12(A):**  \n> *\"All 120-volt, single-phase, 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits supplying outlets or devices installed in dwelling unit... bedrooms, living rooms... shall be protected by any of the means described in 210.12(A)(1) through (6).\"*\n\n**Inspector Note:**  \nAFCI protection is **not required** for fire alarm systems (per exceptions in 210.12(A)), but it is mandatory for all standard 15/20A circuits in the listed areas. The only exceptions are for circuits dedicated to fire alarm systems or those meeting specific installation conditions (e.g., metal raceways).\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

      "answer": "## Subpanel Grounding and Bonding Violations (CEC 2022)\n\n### **Identified Violations:**\n1. **Neutral and Ground Bars Bonded Together**  \n   - **Violation:** CEC 2022 Section 250.4(B)(1) requires **separate neutrals and grounds** in subpanels (not service equipment). Bonding these bars creates a parallel ground path and risks objectionable current on grounding conductors.  \n   - **Correct Configuration:** Neutral and ground bars must be **electrically isolated** in subpanels. The main bonding jumper (which connects neutral and ground) is **only permitted in the main service** (CEC 250.24(B)).\n\n2. **Neutral Bar Bonded to Metal Enclosure**  \n   - **Violation:** CEC 250.104(A) mandates that **only the equipment grounding conductor** (not neutral) connects to the enclosure. Bonding the neutral bar to the enclosure creates a ground loop and violates the requirement for a single, intentional bonding point.  \n   - **Correct Configuration:** The **ground bar** (not neutral bar) must be bonded to the metal enclosure. Neutrals should only connect to the main service panel.\n\n3. **Main Bonding Jumper Installed in Subpanel**  \n   - **Violation:** The main bonding jumper (which connects neutral and ground) is **only allowed in the main service** (CEC 250.24(B)). Its presence in a subpanel creates a duplicate bonding point, risking ground faults.  \n   - **Correct Configuration:** Remove the main bonding jumper from the subpanel. Neutrals in the subpanel must **only connect to the feeder neutral** (which ties back to the main panel’s neutral bar).\n\n---\n\n### **Correct Subpanel Configuration for Detached Garage:**\n1. **Neutral and Ground Separation**  \n   - **Neutral Bar:** Connected only to the **feeder neutral conductor** (from main panel).  \n   - **Ground Bar:** Connected to:  \n     - **Feeder ground conductor** (from main panel).  \n     - **Grounding electrode conductor** (e.g., #6 copper to ground rod).  \n   - **No bonding** between neutral and ground bars.\n\n2. **Enclosure Bonding**  \n   - The **ground bar** is bonded to the metal enclosure via a **screw or bonding jumper** (CEC 250.104(A)).  \n   - **Neutral bar** remains **unbonded** to the enclosure.\n\n3. **Grounding Electrode System**  \n   - A **separate grounding electrode** (e.g., ground rod) is required for the detached subpanel (CEC 250.32(B)).  \n   - The grounding electrode conductor (GEC) connects the ground bar to the electrode (size per CEC Table 250.66 based on feeder size).\n\n---\n\n### **Inspector Notes:**\n- **Violation (1):** Neutral-ground bonding in subpanel creates a parallel path for fault currents.  \n- **Violation (2):** Neutral-to-enclosure bonding risks energizing the enclosure during faults.  \n- **Violation (3):** Main bonding jumper in subpanel violates CEC 250.24(B).  \n\n**Corrected Configuration:**  \n- Neutral and ground bars **separated**.  \n- Ground bar bonded to enclosure and connected to grounding electrode.  \n- Neutral bar isolated and connected only to feeder neutral.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Sections 250.24, 250.4, 250.104",

      "category": "ev_charging",
      "tier": "california_specific",
      "answer": "## Electrical Requirements for EV Charging in New Residential Construction (CEC 2022)\n\n### 1. **Code Compliance Mandates**\n- **CEC Article 625** governs EV charging systems, with additional requirements from **CALGreen Code (Chapter 4/5)** for new construction.  \n- **625.1.1** explicitly requires compliance with CALGreen for EV infrastructure in residential buildings.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Dedicated Branch Circuits**\n- **625.40**: Each EV charging outlet **must be supplied by an individual branch circuit** with **no other outlets** on the circuit.  \n- **Exception**: Not applicable—this rule has no exceptions for residential EV circuits.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **EVSE Location & Installation**\n- **625.50**: EVSE must be installed for **direct electrical coupling** to the vehicle.  \n  - **Indoor locations**: EVSE coupling means must be at least **450 mm (18 in.) above the floor**.  \n  - **Outdoor locations**: Minimum height of **600 mm (24 in.) above grade**.  \n  - **Portable EVSE** (per 625.44(A)) is exempt from height requirements.  \n\n- **625.56**: Outdoor EVSE receptacles must have **weatherproof enclosures** rated for wet locations. Enclosures must remain weatherproof even when the attachment plug is removed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Ground-Fault Protection**\n- **625.60(D)**: **All EVSE receptacles require GFCI protection** for personnel safety.  \n- **Exception**: None—GFCI is mandatory for all EV charging circuits.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Ventilation Requirements**\n- **625.52**: Indoor EV charging areas require ventilation if equipment is listed as needing it.  \n  - **Ventilation rates** depend on **supply voltage/current** and number of EVs (see Tables 625.52(B)(1)(a) and (b)).  \n  - Example: A 240V, 50A circuit for 1 EV requires **9.7 m³/min (342 cfm)** ventilation.  \n  - **Interlock requirement**: Ventilation systems must remain energized during charging.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Panelboard Space Allocation**\n- **408.2(A/B)**: California Energy Code mandates **dedicated circuit breaker spaces** in panelboards for:  \n  - Heat pump water heaters  \n  - Heat pump space heaters  \n  - Electric cooktops  \n  - Electric clothes dryers  \n- **Impact on EV circuits**: Panelboards must include **additional spaces** for EV charging circuits as per load calculations (Article 220).\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Overcurrent Protection**\n- **625.48**: EVSE with power export capabilities (bidirectional charging) must be **listed and marked** for the application.  \n- **Overcurrent protection** must match the EVSE rating and account for maximum fault current (per 625.60(C)).\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Special Considerations**\n- **CALGreen Compliance**: New residential buildings must include **EV-ready infrastructure** (e.g., dedicated circuits and panel spaces) even if EVSE is not yet installed.  \n- **Wire Management**: Conduit and panel wiring must accommodate EV circuits, adhering to **Chapter 9 fill requirements** and **312.6(B) bending space** standards.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Tables\n- **Table 625.52(B)(1)(a/b)**: Ventilation rates for indoor EV charging (cubic meters/feet per minute).  \n- **Table 312.6(B)**: Minimum wire-bending space for panelboard terminations (critical for EV circuit wiring).\n\n---\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022, CALGreen Code",

      "question": "What circuit requirements exist for heat pump water heaters in new dwelling units?",
      "category": "heat_pump",
      "tier": "california_specific",
      "answer": "## Circuit Requirements for Heat Pump Water Heaters in New Dwelling Units (CEC 2022)\n\n### 1. **Branch Circuit Sizing**\n- **Minimum sizing**: 125% of the water heater's nameplate rating (CEC 2022 **422.13**).  \n  Example: A 12A heater requires a circuit rated for at least 15A (12A × 1.25).  \n- **Conductor sizing**: Use Table 310.16 for ampacity based on termination temperature (typically 75°C).  \n- **Overcurrent protection**:  \n  - If the appliance is marked with a specific overcurrent rating, use that value (422.11(A)).  \n  - If unmarked, protection shall not exceed 150% of the appliance's rated current (422.11(E)).  \n    Example: A 12A heater allows up to 18A OCP (12A × 1.5), but standard breakers require rounding down to 15A or up to 20A (if 18A is unavailable).  \n\n### 2. **Dedicated Circuit Requirement**\n- Heat pump water heaters must be supplied by an **individual branch circuit** (422.10(A)).  \n- No other loads may be connected to this circuit.  \n\n### 3. **Disconnecting Means**\n- The branch-circuit switch or circuit breaker must serve as the disconnecting means and comply with:  \n  - **Visibility/Accessibility**: Within sight of the heater or lockable in the open position (422.31).  \n  - **Indicating type**: Switches/circuit breakers must show \"on\" or \"off\" status (422.35).  \n\n### 4. **Nameplate Compliance**\n- The appliance must have a visible nameplate with voltage, amperage, and wattage (422.60(A)).  \n- Use the nameplate rating for load calculations (220.55 for ranges is not applicable here).  \n\n### 5. **Additional Considerations**\n- **Temperature-limiting means**: Required for storage-type heaters (422.47), but this is a safety feature, not a circuit requirement.  \n- **GFCI Protection**: Not explicitly required for water heaters unless located in specific areas (e.g., garages). Check **210.8(D)** for GFCI requirements in dwelling units.  \n\n---\n\n**Inspector Note**: Always verify the appliance's nameplate for manufacturer-specific requirements (422.60). For example, a heat pump water heater rated 15A at 240V would require:  \n- **Conductors**: 10 AWG copper (30A ampacity at 75°C, Table 310.16).  \n- **Overcurrent protection**: 20A breaker (15A × 1.5 = 22.5A; next standard size is 20A).  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Check **210.8(D)** for GFCI requirements in dwelling units.  \n\n---\n\n**Inspector Note**: Always verify the appliance's nameplate for manufacturer-specific requirements (422.60). For example, a heat pump water heater rated 15A at 240V would require:  \n- **Conductors**: 10 AWG copper (30A ampacity at 75°C, Table 310.16).  \n- **Overcurrent protection**: 20A breaker (15A × 1.5 = 22.5A; next standard size is 20A).  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 3 [CEC 2022 Section 330.112] (relevance: 0.45)\n#### 330.112 Insulation\n\nInsulated conductors shall comply with 330.112(A) or (B).\n\n##### (A) 1000 Volts or Less.

The insulation of conductors shall comply with 620.11(A) through (D).\nInformational Note:  One method of determining that the insulation of conductors is flame retardant is by testing the  conductors  or  cables  to  the  VW-1  (Vertical-Wire) Flame Test in ANSI/UL 1581-2011, Reference Standard for Electrical Wires, Cables, and Flexible Cords .\n(A)  Hoistway Door Interlock Wiring. The conductors to the hoistway door interlocks from the hoistway riser shall be one of the following:\n- (1) Flame retardant and suitable for a temperature of not less than 200°C (392°F). Conductors shall be Type SF or equivalent.\n- (2)  Physically protected using an approved method, such that the conductor assembly is flame retardant and suitable for a temperature of not less than 200°C (392°F).\n(B)  Traveling Cables. Traveling cables used as flexible connections between the elevator or dumbwaiter car or counterweight and the raceway shall be of the types of elevator cable listed in Table 400.4 or other approved types.\n(C)  Other  Wiring. All  conductors  in  raceways  shall  have flame-retardant insulation.\nConductors  shall  be  Type  MTW,  TF,  TFF,  TFN,  TFFN, THHN, THW, THWN, TW, XHHW, hoistway cable, or any other conductor with insulation designated as flame retardant.\nShielded conductors shall be permitted if such conductors are insulated for the maximum nominal circuit voltage applied to any conductor within the cable or raceway system.\n(D)  Insulation. All conductors shall have an insulation voltage rating  equal  to  at  least  the  maximum  nominal  circuit  voltage applied  to  any  conductor  within  the  enclosure,  cable,  or  raceway. Insulations and outer coverings that are marked for limited smoke and are so listed shall be permitted.\n\nResult 2 [CEC 2022 Section 310.14] (relevance: 0.50)\n#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts\n\n\n##### (A) General.\n\n- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 3 [CEC 2022 Section 330.112] (relevance: 0.45)\n#### 330.112 Insulation\n\nInsulated conductors shall comply with 330.112(A) or (B).\n\n##### (A) 1000 Volts or Less.
