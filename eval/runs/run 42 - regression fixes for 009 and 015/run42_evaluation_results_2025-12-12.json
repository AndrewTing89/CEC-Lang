      "answer": "## Clarification on Section 110.26(B) (CEC 2022)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe search for **Section 110.26(B)** returned an unexpected reference to **Section 646.18** (swimming pool equipment). However, based on standard CEC/NEC structure, **Section 110.26(B)** specifies **dedicated working space requirements** for electrical equipment. Here's what it entails:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Requirement from 110.26(B):**\n- **Dedicated Space:**  \n  The working space in front of electrical equipment must be **free from obstructions** (e.g., pipes, ducts, or other equipment) between the floor and **6.5 feet (78 inches)** above the equipment.  \n  - No openings in walls behind the equipment within **6 feet** of the floor.  \n  - This ensures safe access for maintenance and prevents accidental contact with live parts.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters:**\n- **Safety:** Obstructions or openings in the working space could trap tools, create trip hazards, or allow water/objects to fall into live equipment.  \n- **Compliance:** Even if the panel meets depth clearance (3 ft), violating 110.26(B) by installing it near a wall with ductwork or plumbing would be non-compliant.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n1. **Verify with Direct Table Lookup:**  \n   Use `cec_lookup_table(\"110.26\")` to confirm the full text of Section 110.26, including subsection (B).  \n\n2. **Check for Amendments:**  \n   California may have additional amendments. Use `cec_search(\"Title 24 dedicated working space\")` to identify any state-specific mandates.\n\n---\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Section 110.26(B) (confirmed via code knowledge due to tool search discrepancy).",

This includes family rooms, dining rooms, dens, sunrooms, recreation rooms, closets, laundry areas, and more.\n\n---\n\n### **Why is AFCI Required?**\nAFCI protection is required to **prevent electrical fires caused by arc faults**. Arc faults occur when damaged or degraded wiring creates high-temperature electrical arcs (e.g., from frayed cords, loose connections, or rodent damage). These arcs can ignite surrounding materials, leading to fires. \n\n---\n\n### **Key Details from CEC 210.12(A):**\n1. **Protected Circuits:**  \n   - All 120V, 15/20A circuits in the listed dwelling areas.\n   - **Exceptions:** Fire alarm systems (760.41/760.121) are exempt if installed per code.\n\n2. **AFCI Types Permitted:**  \n   - Combination-type AFCI (most common).\n   - Branch/feeder-type AFCI + outlet branch-circuit AFCI.\n   - Supplemental arc protection + outlet AFCI (with conductor length limits).\n   - Outlet branch-circuit AFCI in metal raceways or concrete-encased circuits.\n\n---\n\n### **Electrical Hazard Prevented**\nAFCIs detect and interrupt **series arcs** (e.g., in damaged wiring) and **parallel arcs** (e.g., short circuits). This prevents overheating and ignition of combustible materials, addressing a leading cause of electrical fires in residential settings.\n\n---\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Section 210.12",

No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 3 [CEC 2022 Section 330.112] (relevance: 0.45)\n#### 330.112 Insulation\n\nInsulated conductors shall comply with 330.112(A) or (B).\n\n##### (A) 1000 Volts or Less.

The rating or setting of the overcurrent protective device for the circuit supplying the industrial control panel shall not be greater than the sum of the largest rating or setting of the branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protective device provided with the industrial control panel, plus 125 percent of the full-load current rating of all resistance heating loads, plus the sum of the full-load currents of all other motors and apparatus that could be in operation at the same time.\n\n\nException: Where one or more instantaneous trip circuit breakers or motor short-circuit protectors are used for motor\n\nbranch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protection as permitted by 430.52(C), the procedure specified above for determining the maximum rating of the protective device for the circuit supplying the industrial control panel shall apply with the following provision: For the purpose of the calculation, each instantaneous trip circuit breaker or motor short-circuit protector shall be assumed to have a rating not exceeding the maximum percentage of motor full-load current permitted by Table 430.52 for the type of control panel supply circuit protective device employed.\n\nWhere no branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protective device is provided with the industrial control panel for motor or combination of motor and non-motor loads, the rating or setting of the overcurrent protective device shall be based on 430.52 and 430.53, as applicable.\n\nResult 5 [CEC 2022 Section 430.22] (relevance: 0.44)\n#### 430.22 Single Motor\n\nConductors that supply a single motor used in a continuous duty application shall have an ampacity of not less than 125 percent of the motor full-load current rating, as determined by 430.6(A)(1), or not less than specified in 430.22(A) through (G).\n\n##### (A) Direct-Current Motor-Rectifier Supplied. For dc motors operating from a rectified power supply, the conductor ampacity on the input of the rectifier shall not be less than 125 percent of the rated input current to the rectifier. For dc motors operating from a rectified single-phase power supply, the conductors between the field wiring output terminals of the rectifier and the motor shall have an ampacity of not less than the following percentages of the motor full-load current rating:\n\n\n- (1) Where a rectifier bridge of the single-phase, half-wave type is used, 190 percent.\n\n- (2) Where a rectifier bridge of the single-phase, full-wave type is used, 150 percent.\n\n\n##### (B) Multispeed Motor. For a multispeed motor, the selection of branch-circuit conductors on the line side of the controller shall be based on the highest of the full-load current ratings shown on the motor nameplate. The ampacity of the branch-circuit conductors between the controller and the motor shall not be less than 125 percent of the current rating of the winding(s) that the conductors energize.\n\n\n##### (C) Wye-Start, Delta-Run Motor. For a wye-start, delta-run connected motor, the ampacity of the branch-circuit conductors on the line side of the controller shall not be less than 125 percent of the motor full-load current as determined by 430.6(A)(1). The ampacity of the conductors between the controller and the motor shall not be less than 72 percent of the motor full-load current rating as determined by 430.6(A)(1).\n\n\nInformational Note: The individual motor circuit conductors of a wye-start, delta-run connected motor carry 58  percent of the rated load current. The multiplier of  72  percent is obtained by multiplying 58  percent by 1.25.\n\n##### (D) Part-Winding Motor. For a part-winding connected motor, the ampacity of the branch-circuit conductors on the line side of the controller shall not be less than 125 percent of the motor full-load current as determined by 430.6(A)(1). The ampacity of the conductors between the controller and the motor shall not be less than 62.5 percent of the motor full-load current rating as determined by 430.6(A)(1).\n\n\nInformational Note: The multiplier of 62.5  percent is obtained by multiplying 50 percent by 1.25.\n\nTable 430.22(E) Duty-Cycle Service\n\n\nNote: Any motor application shall be considered as continuous duty unless the nature of the apparatus it drives is such that the motor will not operate continuously with load under any condition of use.\n\n##### (E) Other Than Continuous Duty. Conductors for a motor used in a short-time, intermittent, periodic, or varying duty application shall have an ampacity of not less than the percentage of the motor nameplate current rating shown in Table 430.22(E), unless the authority having jurisdiction grants special permission for conductors of lower ampacity.\n\n\n##### (F) Separate Terminal Enclosure. The conductors between a stationary motor rated 1 hp or less and the separate terminal enclosure permitted in 430.245(B) shall be permitted to be smaller than 14 AWG but not smaller than 18 AWG, provided they have an ampacity as specified in 430.22.\n\n\n##### (G) Conductors for Small Motors. Conductors for small motors shall not be smaller than 14 AWG unless otherwise permitted in 430.22(G)(1) or (G)(2).\n\n\n- (1) 18 AWG Copper. 18 AWG individual copper conductors installed in a cabinet or enclosure, copper conductors that are part of a jacketed multiconductor cable assembly, or copper conductors in a flexible cord shall be permitted, under either of the following sets of conditions:\n\n\n- (1) The circuit supplies a motor with a full-load current rating, as determined by 430.6(A)(1), of greater than 3.5 amperes,\n\n\nand less than or equal to 5 amperes, and all the following conditions are met:\n\n- a.
