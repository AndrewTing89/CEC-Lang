      "answer": "## Panelboard Space Requirements for Single-Family Dwellings (CEC 2022 vs NEC 2023)\n\n---\n\n### **California Electrical Code (CEC 2022) Requirements**\n1. **Reserved Circuit Breaker Spaces** (CEC 408.2(A)):\n   - **Mandated appliances**: Heat pump water heaters, heat pump space heaters, electric cooktops, and electric clothes dryers.\n   - **Code basis**: California Energy Code Sections 150.0(n), (t), (u), (v).\n\n2. **Heat Pump Space Heater Readiness** (CEC 440.3(E)):\n   - Requires designated spaces, receptacles, and branch circuits for heat pump space heaters.\n\n3. **Exceptions**:\n   - Special permission exceptions (424.10, 426.14) apply to **installation methods**, not panelboard space reservations.\n\n---\n\n### **National Electrical Code (NEC 2023) Comparison**\n- **No appliance-specific reserved spaces**: NEC does not mandate reserved panelboard spaces for specific appliances (e.g., heat pump water heaters, cooktops).\n- **General requirements**:\n  - Panelboard ratings must match calculated loads (NEC 408.30).\n  - Disconnecting means for fixed electric space heaters (NEC 424.19).\n  - No provisions for appliance-specific readiness (e.g., heat pump circuits).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences**\n| **Aspect**                     | **CEC 2022**                                                                 | **NEC 2023**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Reserved Spaces**           | Mandates spaces for heat pump water heaters, cooktops, dryers, etc.        | No specific appliance reservations; general space requirements apply.       |\n| **Heat Pump Readiness**       | Requires designated circuits and receptacles for heat pump space heaters.    | No specific provisions for heat pump readiness.                              |\n| **Code Basis**                | California Energy Code Sections 150.0(n), (t), (u), (v).                     | No equivalent provisions in NEC.                                             |\n| **Exceptions**                | Exceptions apply to installation methods, not panelboard space mandates. | General exceptions for disconnecting means and reconditioned equipment.      |\n\n---\n\n### **Appliances Requiring Reserved Spaces in CEC**\n1. Heat pump water heaters  \n2. Heat pump space heaters  \n3. Electric cooktops  \n4. Electric clothes dryers  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nCalifornia’s CEC 2022 imposes **stricter, appliance-specific requirements** for panelboard spaces in single-family dwellings compared to NEC 2023. These mandates ensure readiness for energy-efficient appliances like heat pumps, aligning with California’s energy efficiency goals. NEC 2023 lacks these specific provisions, focusing instead on general panelboard and disconnecting means requirements.\n\n✓ **Source**: CEC 2022 Sections 408.2(A), 440.3(E); NEC 2023 Sections 408.30, 424.19  \n✓ **Comparison**: CEC mandates appliance-specific reserved spaces; NEC does not.",

CALGreen Compliance (CEC 625.1.1)**  \n- **Mandatory for new residential construction**:  \n  - Reserved panel space for EV charging (CALGreen Chapter 4).  \n  - EV-ready infrastructure (CALGreen Chapter 5).  \n\n#### **2. Cords and Cables (CEC 625.17)**  \n- **Maximum cord lengths**:  \n  - Portable EVSE: **25 ft (7.5 m)**.  \n  - Stationary equipment: **6 ft (1.8 m)** power-supply cord.  \n- **Cable types**: Must use listed EV cable (EV, EVJ, etc.) or hard service cord (Table 400.4).  \n\n#### **3. Ventilation (CEC 625.52)**  \n- **Indoor charging**:  \n  - If equipment isn’t listed for indoor use, **mechanical ventilation** is required.  \n  - Ventilation must be **interlocked with the charging system**.  \n\n#### **4. Ground-Fault Protection (CEC 625.54)**  \n- **All EV receptacles** require **GFCI protection** (no exceptions for <60V DC).  \n\n#### **5. NEC vs CEC Differences**  \n- **CALGreen mandates**: No NEC equivalent.  \n- **Stricter cord/ventilation rules**: CEC adds 25 ft max cord length and ventilation interlocks.  \n- **GFCI exceptions**: CEC requires GFCI for all EVSE (<60V DC still requires protection).  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Citations**  \n- **CEC 625.1, 625.1.1, 625.17, 625.52, 625.54**  \n- **CALGreen Chapter 4/5**  \n- **NEC 220.57, 210.8(B)(9)**  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

Scope and Definitions**\n- **CEC 625.1**:  \n  - Mandates compliance with **CALGreen Chapter 4/5** for new residential construction (California-specific).  \n  - Explicitly includes **power export** and **bidirectional charging** systems.  \n  - References **UL 2594** and **UL 2202** for EVSE safety.  \n\n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  - General scope aligns with CEC but lacks CALGreen integration.  \n  - Definitions (e.g., EVSE, EVPE) are similar but without California-specific sustainability mandates.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Cords and Cables**\n- **CEC 625.17**:  \n  - **Maximum cord lengths**:  \n    - Portable EVSE: **25 ft (7.5 m)** unless using a cable management system.  \n    - Stationary equipment: **6 ft (1.8 m)** power-supply cord.  \n  - Requires **listed EV cable types** (EV, EVJ, etc.) for output cables.  \n  - **Hard service cord** must be rated for oil/damp/wet locations.  \n\n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  - No specific length limits for EVSE cords (general cord requirements in 400.5/400.7 apply).  \n  - Allows flexible cords per 400.5 but lacks EV-specific cable types or length restrictions.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Ventilation Requirements**\n- **CEC 625.52**:  \n  - **Mandatory mechanical ventilation** for indoor EV charging if equipment isn’t listed for indoor use.  \n  - Ventilation must be **interlocked with the charging system** (supply/exhaust to outdoors).  \n  - Ventilation formulas depend on number of EVs and power levels.  \n\n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  - No specific ventilation requirements for residential EV charging.  \n  - Industrial applications may reference NFPA 505, but not for residential use.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Ground-Fault Protection**\n- **CEC 625.54**:  \n  - **All EV charging receptacles** must have **GFCI protection** (per 210.8 + CEC addendum).  \n  - No exceptions for low-voltage systems (<60V DC).  \n\n- **NEC 2023 210.8**:  \n  - Requires GFCI for EV receptacles (210.8(B)(9)) but allows exceptions for systems ≤ 150V AC or 100V DC.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Load Calculations**\n- **CEC**:  \n  - References **CALGreen** for electrification mandates (e.g., reserved panel space, EV-ready infrastructure).  \n  - No explicit load calculation formula in 625, but aligns with NEC 220.57.  \n\n- **NEC 220.57**:  \n  - EVSE load calculated at **7200 VA** or nameplate rating (whichever is larger).  \n\n---\n\n### **6.

NEC allows shared circuits and lacks panelboard readiness rules unless locally adopted. Both codes use **identical demand factors** for dryer load calculations (Table 220.54).",

For example, motor circuits (Article 430) may use higher overcurrent ratings per 430.52, while industrial busways may follow 240.100/240.101.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Exceptions",

For example, motor circuits (Article 430) may use higher overcurrent ratings per 430.52, while industrial busways may follow 240.100/240.101.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Exceptions",

Practical Implications**  \n1. **Hazardous Circuits**:  \n   - CEC allows simplified protection (short-circuit/ground-fault only) for critical systems like fire pumps.  \n   - NEC requires full overcurrent protection.  \n\n2. **Transformer Protection**:  \n   - CEC permits primary-side OCPD for small transformers (<50 VA) and two-wire secondaries.  \n   - NEC lacks explicit rules for transformer secondary protection.  \n\n3. **Conductor Sizing**:  \n   - Both codes use the same table values, but CEC’s explicit cross-references ensure compliance with **310.19/310.16** for Column B/C.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. California Amendments**  \n- **Explicit Multipliers**: CEC clarifies Column B/C calculations using **310.19 × 400%** and **310.16 × 300%**, while NEC references are implicit.  \n- **Hazard-Based Exceptions**: CEC includes exceptions for life-safety systems (e.g., fire pumps) not found in NEC.  \n\n---\n\n**✓ Source**: CEC 2022 & NEC 2023",

Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 9 [CEC 2022 Section 392.22(A)] (relevance: 0.32)\n##### (A) Number of Multiconductor Cables, Rated 2000 Volts or Less, in Cable Trays.

      "answer": "## General Lighting Load for Office Buildings (CEC 2022 vs NEC 2023)\n\n**California Code (CEC 2022):**  \n**1.3 VA per square foot** (14 VA/m²) per **Table 220.12**. This value includes the 125% continuous load multiplier from 210.20(A).\n\n**NEC 2023:**  \n**1.5 VA per square foot** (16 VA/m²) per **Table 220.42(A)** for office buildings. No automatic continuous load multiplier is applied unless specified in 210.20(A).\n\n---\n\n### Key Differences:\n1. **Amended Value in CEC:**  \n   California reduces the office lighting load from **1.5 VA/ft² (NEC)** to **1.3 VA/ft²** to align with stricter energy efficiency standards (Title 24, Part 6).\n\n2. **Continuous Load Multiplier:**  \n   - **CEC:** 125% multiplier is **included** in Table 220.12 values.  \n   - **NEC:** 125% multiplier is **not included** in Table 220.42(A) and must be applied separately if required by 210.20(A).\n\n3. **Exception for Energy Code Compliance (CEC 220.12(B)):**  \n   If the building complies with a local energy code, alternative calculations are permitted **with monitoring systems** and alarms for load management.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Reference Notes:\n- **CEC 220.12** explicitly includes the 125% multiplier in its table values.  \n- **NEC 220.42(A)** requires separate application of demand factors and does not embed the multiplier in the table.  \n- California’s amendment reflects Title 24 energy code requirements, which prioritize reduced baseline loads for commercial buildings.\n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Table 220.12, NEC 2023 Table 220.42(A)",

For flexible cords, see Table 400.4, Table 400.5(A)(a), and Table 400.5(A)(b).\n\n## (B) Ambient Temperature Correction Factors. ∆\n\n- (1) General. Ampacities for ambient temperatures other than those shown in the ampacity tables shall be corrected in accordance with Table 310.15(B)(1) or Table 310.15(B)(2), or shall be permitted to be calculated using Equation 310.15(B). N\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nI ′ = ampacity corrected for ambient temperature\n\nI = ampacity shown in the tables\n\nTc = temperature rating of conductor (°C)\n\nTa ′ = new ambient temperature (°C)\n\nTa = ambient temperature used in the table (°C)\n\n- (2) Rooftop. For raceways or cables exposed to direct sunlight on or above rooftops where the distance above the roof to the bottom of the raceway or cable is less than 23  mm ( 7 /8 in.), a temperature adder of 33°C (60°F) shall be added to the outdoor temperature to determine the applicable ambient temperature for application of the correction factors in Table 310.15(B)(1) or Table 310.15(B)(2).

The count shall not include conductors that are connected to electrical components that cannot be simultaneously energized.\n\nInformational Note: One source for the ambient temperatures in various locations is the ASHRAE Handbook Fundamentals .\n\n## (C) Adjustment Factors. ∆\n\n- (1) More than Three Current-Carrying Conductors. The ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced as shown in Table 310.15(C)(1) where the number of current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable exceeds three, or where single conductors or multiconductor cables not installed in raceways are installed without maintaining spacing for a continuous length longer than 600 mm (24  in.). Each current-carrying conductor of a paralleled set of conductors shall be counted as a current- carrying conductor. N\n\n\nWhere conductors of different systems, as provided in 300.3, are installed in a common raceway or cable, the adjustment factors shown in Table 310.15(C)(1) shall apply only to the number of power and lighting conductors (Articles 210, 215, 220, and 230).\n\nInformational Note No. 1: See Annex B for adjustment factors for more than three current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable with load diversity.\n\nInformational Note No.  2: See 366.23 for adjustment factors for conductors and ampacity for bare copper and aluminum bars in auxiliary gutters and 376.22(B) for adjustment factors for conductors in metal wireways.\n\n(a) Where conductors are installed in cable trays, the provisions of 392.80 shall apply.\n\n(b) Adjustment factors shall not apply to conductors in raceways having a length not exceeding 600 mm (24 in.).\n\n(c) Adjustment factors shall not apply to underground conductors entering or leaving an outdoor trench if those conductors have physical protection in the form of rigid metal conduit, intermediate metal conduit, rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit (PVC), or reinforced thermosetting resin conduit (RTRC) having a length not exceeding 3.05 m (10 ft), and if the number of conductors does not exceed four.\n\n(d) Adjustment factors shall not apply to Type AC cable or to Type MC cable under the following conditions:\n\n- (1) The cables do not have an overall outer jacket.\n\n- (2) Each cable has not more than three current-carrying conductors.\n\n- (3) The conductors are 12 AWG copper.\n\n- (4) Not more than 20 current-carrying conductors are installed without maintaining spacing, are stacked, or are supported on 'bridle rings.'\n\n\nException to (4): If cables meeting the requirements in 310.15(C) (1)(d)(1) through (C)(1)(d)(3) with more than 20  current-carrying conductors are installed longer than 600  mm (24  in.) without maintaining spacing, are stacked, or are supported on bridle rings, a 60 percent adjustment factor shall be applied.\n\n- (2) Raceway Spacing. Spacing between raceways shall be maintained. N\n\n\n##### (D) Bare or Covered Conductors. Where bare or covered conductors are installed with insulated conductors, the temperature rating of the bare or covered conductor shall be equal to the lowest temperature rating of the insulated conductors for the purpose of determining ampacity.\n\n\n##### (E) Neutral Conductor. Neutral conductors shall be considered current carrying in accordance with any of the following: ∆\n\n- (1) A neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be required to be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (2) In a 3-wire circuit consisting of two phase conductors and the neutral conductor of a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system, a common conductor carries approximately the same current as the line-to-neutral load currents of the other conductors and shall be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (3) On a 4-wire, 3-phase wye circuit where the major portion of the load consists of nonlinear loads, harmonic currents are present in the neutral conductor; the neutral conductor shall therefore be considered a current-carrying conductor.\n\n##### (F) Grounding or Bonding Conductor. A grounding or bonding conductor shall not be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1). ∆\n\nException 5 [CEC 2022 Section 310.14] (relevance: 0.21)\n#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts\n\n\n##### (A) General.\n\n- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n",

Neutral conductors shall be considered current carrying in accordance with any of the following: ∆\n\n- (1) A neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be required to be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (2) In a 3-wire circuit consisting of two phase conductors and the neutral conductor of a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system, a common conductor carries approximately the same current as the line-to-neutral load currents of the other conductors and shall be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (3) On a 4-wire, 3-phase wye circuit where the major portion of the load consists of nonlinear loads, harmonic currents are present in the neutral conductor; the neutral conductor shall therefore be considered a current-carrying conductor.\n\n##### (F) Grounding or Bonding Conductor. A grounding or bonding conductor shall not be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1). ∆\n\nException 5 [CEC 2022 Section 310.14] (relevance: 0.21)\n#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts\n\n\n##### (A) General.\n\n- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n",

CEC aligns fully with NEC 2023 for this specific requirement.\n- Both codes reference the **same tables** (310.19 for conductor ampacity, 430.72(B) for overcurrent limits).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n- **CEC 2022:** 10A maximum overcurrent protection for 16 AWG copper conductors extending beyond the enclosure.\n- **NEC 2023:** Identical 10A requirement.\n- **Conclusion:** California follows NEC without amendments for this provision.\n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Table 430.72(B) and NEC 2023 Table 430.72(B)(2)",

AC Module Treatment**  \n- **CEC 690.6 (Exception)**  \n  - **Key Exception**: PV source circuit requirements **do not apply** to AC modules.  \n  - **Internal Component Rule**: PV source circuits, conductors, and inverters are treated as **internal components** of AC modules.  \n  - **Output Circuit**: Output of AC modules is classified as an **inverter output circuit** (per 690.6(B)).  \n  - **NEC 2023**: No specific exception for AC modules; PV source circuits are treated as standard DC circuits.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. PV-Powered Signs**  \n- **CEC 600.34**  \n  - Mandates compliance with **Article 690** for PV-powered signs.  \n  - **California-Specific Rules**:  \n    - Wiring must be **listed for PV applications**, secured every 0.91m (3 ft), and protected from damage.  \n    - Flexible cords must be **extra hard usage**, **outdoor-rated**, and **water/sunlight-resistant**.  \n  - **NEC 2023**: No specific provisions for PV-powered signs.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Energy Storage Integration**  \n- **CEC 690.71**  \n  - Requires energy storage systems to comply with **Article 706**.  \n  - **NEC 2023**: Article 706 exists but is not explicitly cross-referenced in NEC 690.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. System Connections**  \n- **CEC 690.59**  \n  - PV systems connected to other sources must follow **Article 705** and **Article 712** (microgrids).  \n  - **NEC 2023**: Article 705 applies but lacks reference to microgrids (Article 712).  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Equipment and Installation**  \n- **CEC 690.4(B)**  \n  - Requires inverters, combiners, and charge controllers to be **listed** with **field labels**.  \n  - **NEC 2023**: Requires listing but no field label mandate.  \n\n- **CEC 690.4(C)**  \n  - Installation must be performed by **qualified persons** (per Article 100).  \n  - **NEC 2023**: Permits installation by qualified personnel but no field-specific qualification mandate.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Grounding and Rapid Shutdown**  \n- **CEC 690.91 (Implied by 600.34(D))**  \n  - Grounding must follow **Article 690, Part V** with additional focus on **PV-powered sign grounding**.  \n  - **NEC 2023**: Grounding requirements (690.41–690.47) are similar but lack California’s sign-specific rules.  \n\n- **Rapid Shutdown**:  \n  - **CEC**: Enforced via **Article 690.11** with California-specific labeling and clearance requirements.  \n  - **NEC 2023**: Requires rapid shutdown per 690.11 but without California amendments.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key California Amendments**  \n| **CEC Section** | **NEC 2023 Equivalent** | **California Addition** |  \n|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|  \n| **690.6**       | None                     | AC module internal component rule (exception) |  \n| 600.34         | None                     | PV-powered sign wiring/grounding |  \n| 690.71         | 706 (partial)            | Explicit energy storage integration |  \n| 690.59         | 705                      | Microgrid (Article 712) reference |  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nCalifornia’s CEC 2022 **extends NEC 2023** with:  \n1. **AC Module Exception** (690.6): Treats internal components as part of the module.  \n2. **PV-Powered Sign Rules**: Unique wiring and grounding mandates.  \n3. **Energy Storage and Microgrid References**: Explicit integration requirements.  \n4. **Field Labels and Qualified Personnel**: Additional installation safeguards.  \n\nAlways verify **CEC exceptions** (e.g., 690.6 for AC modules) override NEC defaults in California.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",
