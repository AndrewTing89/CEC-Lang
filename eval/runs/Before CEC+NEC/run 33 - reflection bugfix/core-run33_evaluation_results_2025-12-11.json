      "answer": "## AFCI Protection for Bedroom Circuits (CEC 2022)\n\n**Answer:**  \nYes, **AFCI protection is required** for bedroom circuits in new residential construction per **CEC 2022 Section 210.12(A)**.  \n\n**Details:**  \n- **Section 210.12(A)** explicitly lists bedrooms as one of the required locations for arc-fault circuit-interrupter (AFCI) protection.  \n- The rule applies to **all 120-volt, single-phase, 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits** supplying outlets or devices in bedrooms.  \n- Permitted AFCI protection methods include:  \n  1. A **combination-type AFCI** at the service panel.  \n  2. A **branch/feeder-type AFCI** at the panel combined with an outlet branch-circuit-type AFCI at the first outlet.  \n  3. Other listed combinations (e.g., supplemental protection + outlet AFCI).  \n\n**Exceptions:**  \n- No exceptions apply to new construction. The only exceptions relate to:  \n  - Fire alarm systems (not applicable here).  \n  - Limited modifications/extensions (not relevant for new construction).  \n\n**Inspector Note:**  \nVerify the AFCI type and installation location per **210.12(A)(1)-(6)**. Bedrooms must use one of the listed protection methods.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Section 210.12(A)",

A **combination-type AFCI** at the service panel.  \n  2. A **branch/feeder-type AFCI** at the panel combined with an outlet branch-circuit-type AFCI at the first outlet.  \n  3. Other listed combinations (e.g., supplemental protection + outlet AFCI).  \n\n**Exceptions:**  \n- No exceptions apply to new construction. The only exceptions relate to:  \n  - Fire alarm systems (not applicable here).  \n  - Limited modifications/extensions (not relevant for new construction).  \n\n**Inspector Note:**  \nVerify the AFCI type and installation location per **210.12(A)(1)-(6)**.

For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances.

Part V provides calculation methods for farm loads.\n\nInformational Note No. 1: See examples in Informative Annex D.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: See Figure 220.1 for information on the organization of Article 220.\n\nResult 3 [CEC 2022 Section 220.87] (relevance: 27.21)\n#### 220.87 Determining Existing Loads\n\nThe calculation of a feeder or service load for existing installations shall be permitted to use actual maximum demand to determine the existing load under all of the following conditions:\n\n- (1) The maximum demand data is available for a 1-year period.\n\n\nException: If the maximum demand data for a 1-year period is not available, the calculated load shall be permitted to be based on the maximum demand (the highest average kilowatts reached and maintained for a 15-minute interval) continuously recorded over a minimum 30-day period using a recording ammeter or power meter connected to the highest loaded phase of the feeder or service, based on the initial loading at the start of the recording. The recording shall reflect the maximum demand of the feeder or service by being taken when the building or space is occupied and shall include by measurement or calculation the larger of the heating or cooling equipment load, and other loads that may be periodic in nature due to seasonal or similar conditions.\n\n- (2) The maximum demand at 125 percent plus the new load does not exceed the ampacity of the feeder or rating of the service.\n\n- (3) The feeder has overcurrent protection in accordance with 240.4, and the service has overload protection in accordance with 230.90.\n\n\nException: If the feeder or service has any renewable energy system (i.e., solar photovoltaic systems or wind electric systems) or employs any form of peak load shaving, this calculation method shall not be permitted.\n\nResult 4 [CEC 2022 Section 220.60] (relevance: 25.43)\n#### 220.60 Noncoincident Loads\n\nWhere it is unlikely that two or more noncoincident loads will be in use simultaneously, it shall be permissible to use only the largest load(s) that will be used at one time for calculating the total load of a feeder or service. Where a motor is part of the noncoincident load and is not the largest of the noncoincident loads, 125 percent of the motor load shall be used in the calculation if it is the largest motor.\n\nResult 5 [CEC 2022 Section 220.86] (relevance: 25.37)\n#### 220.86 Schools\n\nThe calculation of a feeder or service load for schools shall be permitted in accordance with Table 220.86 in lieu of Part III of this article where equipped with electric space heating, air conditioning, or both. The connected load to which the demand factors of Table 220.86 apply shall include all of the interior and exterior lighting, power, water heating, cooking, other loads, and the larger of the air-conditioning load or space-heating load within the building or structure.\n\nTable 220.86 Optional Method - Demand Factors for Feeders and Service Conductors for Schools\n\n\nTable 220.88 Optional Method - Permitted Load Calculations for Service and Feeder Conductors for New Restaurants\n\n\nNote: Add all electrical loads, including both heating and cooling loads, to calculate the total connected load. Select the one demand factor that applies from the table, then multiply the total connected load by this single demand factor.\n\nFeeders and service conductors whose calculated load is determined by this optional calculation shall be permitted to have the neutral load determined by 220.61. Where the building or structure load is calculated by this optional method, feeders within the building or structure shall have ampacity as permitted in Part III of this article; however, the ampacity of an individual feeder shall not be required to be larger than the ampacity for the entire building.\n\nThis section shall not apply to portable classroom buildings.\n\n\n============================================================\n[REFERENCED TABLE DATA - Use these exact values]\n============================================================\n### Table 220.88: Optional Method — Permitted Load Calculations for Service and Feeder Conductors for New Restaurants\ntotal_connected_load | all_electric | not_all_electric\n--- | --- | ---\n0–200 | 80% | 100%\n201–325 | 10% (amount over 200) + 160.0 | 50% (amount over 200) + 200.0\n326–800 | 50% (amount over 325) + 172.5 | 45% (amount over 325) + 262.5\nOver 800 | 50% (amount over 800) + 410.0 | 20% (amount over 800) + 476.3\n\n### Table 220.86: Optional Method — Demand Factors for Feeders and Service Conductors for Schools\nva_per_m2 | va_per_ft2 | demand_factor | calculated_load\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n0–33 | 0–3 | 100 | Amount × 100%\nOver 33–220 | Over 3–20 | 75 | (Amount × 75%) + 3\nRemainder over 220 | Remainder over 20 | 25 | (Amount × 25%) + 15.75",
