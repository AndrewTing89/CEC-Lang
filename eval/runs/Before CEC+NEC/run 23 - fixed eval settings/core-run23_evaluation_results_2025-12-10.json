The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

Why AFCI Protection is Required**  \n- **NEC 210.12(A)** mandates **arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) protection** for **15- and 20-ampere branch circuits** supplying outlets in **bedrooms** of dwelling units.  \n- **NEC 210.12(B)** extends this requirement to **living rooms, family rooms, and similar areas** (e.g., dens, recreation rooms).  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Electrical Hazard Prevented**  \nAFCI protection prevents **electrical fires caused by arc faults** in the wiring system.  \n- **Arc faults** occur when damaged or worn insulation, loose connections, or other wiring issues create high-resistance arcs.  \n- These arcs can **generate intense heat (up to 10,000°F)**, igniting nearby combustible materials (e.g., wood, paper, fabric).  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Code Citations**  \n- **NEC 210.12(A)**:  \n  > *\"In dwelling units, all 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits supplying outlets in bedrooms shall be protected by a listed arc-fault circuit interrupter, installed to provide protection of the branch circuit.\"*  \n- **NEC 210.12(B)**:  \n  > *\"In dwelling units, all 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits supplying outlets in other than kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and areas specified in 210.12(A) shall be protected by a listed arc-fault circuit interrupter.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Rationale for Specific Areas**  \n- **Bedrooms and living areas** are high-risk locations for arc faults due to:  \n  - Frequent use of portable appliances and extension cords.  \n  - Concealed wiring in walls that may degrade over time.  \n  - Increased likelihood of physical damage to cords or outlets.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. How AFCI Differs from GFCI**  \n- **AFCI** protects against **fire hazards** (arc faults).  \n- **GFCI** protects against **shock hazards** (ground faults).  \n- Both are required in different areas (e.g., GFCI for kitchens/bathrooms, AFCI for bedrooms/living rooms).  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Exceptions**  \n- AFCI protection is **not required** for:  \n  - Circuits supplying **fixed appliances** (e.g., ovens, dishwashers).  \n  - Circuits in **kitchens, bathrooms, garages** (covered by other requirements).  \n\n[OK] Source: NEC 2023",

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.
