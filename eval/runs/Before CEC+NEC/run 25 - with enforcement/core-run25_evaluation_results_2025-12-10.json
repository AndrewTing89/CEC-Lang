      "question": "Why does the NEC require AFCI protection for bedrooms and living areas? What electrical hazard does it prevent?",
      "answer": "## Why NEC Requires AFCI Protection in Bedrooms and Living Areas (NEC 2023)\n\n### **Requirement**\nPer **NEC 210.12(B)**, all 120-volt, single-phase, 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits supplying outlets in **bedrooms, living rooms, and similar areas** in dwelling units must have **AFCI protection**. This includes:\n- Bedrooms\n- Living rooms\n- Hallways\n- Closets\n- Similar locations\n\n### **Purpose: Electrical Hazard Prevented**\nAFCI (Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupter) protection is required to **prevent electrical fires caused by arc faults** in branch circuits. Arc faults occur when there is a broken circuit that allows high-energy arcs to form, often due to:\n- Damaged or degraded wiring\n- Loose connections\n- Overloaded circuits\n- Faulty appliances\n\nThese arcs can ignite surrounding materials (e.g., wood, insulation, fabric), leading to fires. AFCIs detect dangerous arcing conditions and de-energize the circuit before a fire can start.\n\n### **Key Details from NEC**\n- **Section 210.12(A)** outlines acceptable methods for AFCI protection (e.g., combination-type, branch/feeder-type, outlet branch-circuit-type).\n- **Exceptions** apply for specific systems (e.g., fire alarm circuits, arc welding equipment until 2025).\n- **Informational Notes** reference UL standards (e.g., UL 1699) and NFPA 72 for additional guidance on AFCI types and fire alarm systems.\n\n### **Why Bedrooms and Living Areas?**\nThese areas are high-risk because:\n1. **High electrical usage**: Multiple devices plugged in, increasing the chance of overloads or faults.\n2. **Flexible wiring**: Frequent use of extension cords or portable heaters, which can stress wiring.\n3. **Occupant safety**: Fires in these areas pose direct risk to occupants, especially during sleep or relaxation.\n\n### **[OK] Source**: NEC 2023 Section 210.12",
