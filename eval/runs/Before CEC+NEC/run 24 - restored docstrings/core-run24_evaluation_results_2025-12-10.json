Is This a Code Violation?**  \n**Yes**, this is a violation of **CEC 2022 Section 408.41** and **NEC 110.14(A)**.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Code Requirements**  \n#### **CEC 2022 Section 408.41**  \n- **Grounded conductor terminations** must terminate in **individual terminals** not shared with other conductors.  \n- **Exception**: Only allowed for **parallel conductors** if the terminal is **listed for multiple conductors** (e.g., marked \"2\" or \"2 wires\").  \n\n#### **NEC 110.14(A)** (Adopted by CEC)  \n- Connections must be made **in accordance with the device's listing**.  \n- Terminals not marked for multiple conductors **cannot accept more than one wire**.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Why This Violates Code**  \n- The breaker terminal is **not marked for two conductors**, violating **110.14(A)**.  \n- Even if the terminal were marked, **12 AWG copper** on a 20A breaker is acceptable for ampacity (per Table 310.16), but the **termination method** is invalid.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Risks**  \n- **Overheating**: Poor contact between two wires increases resistance.  \n- **Failure to trip**: Breaker may not operate properly during overloads/short circuits.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Corrective Actions**  \n1. **Use a terminal marked for two conductors** (e.g., \"2\" stamp).  \n2. **Install a second 20A breaker** and run a separate conductor to the load.  \n\n---\n\n### **6.

Over 12 kW through 27 kW ranges all of same rating. For ranges individually rated more than 12 kW but not more than 27 kW, the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each additional kilowatt of rating or major fraction thereof by which the rating of individual ranges exceeds 12 kW.\n\n2. Over 8 3 /4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.\n\n4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.\n\n5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 1 3 /4 kW and used in instructional programs.\n\nTable 220.56 Demand Factors for Kitchen Equipment - Other Than Dwelling Unit(s)\n\n\n##### (B) General Loads.

For thermoset insulated conductors, a knit outer covering shall consist of 20 percent or more cotton and 80 percent or less synthetic fiber. For thermoplastic insulated conductors, a knit outer covering shall be integral with the insulation. Nonintegral thermoplastic outer coverings shall consist of a weave (such as straight fiber or twisted fiber) or braid construction. For hard usage cords, Types S, SE, SEW, SEO, SEOW, SEOO, and SEOOW, the outer covering shall be of nylon or other material of equal or better performance. For extra-hard usage cords, the outer covering shall consist of a weave of cotton, nylon, or other material of equivalent mechanical strength.\n  - Elevator traveling cables for operating current and signal circuits, other than conductor sizes of Types E, EO, ETP, and ETT elevator cables, be permitted to incorporate in the construction one or more single-conductor or multiconductor communications cables. Types E, EO, ETP, and ETT elevator cables also be permitted to incorporate in the construction one or more communications cables, and one or more optical fiber cables, all of which shall be permitted to be color coded in accordance with 310.120, Table 310.120(C)(1). All cable conductors shall consist of a conductor, insulation, and a shield for use in either or all of the cable assemblies that shall not run solely through the center.\n  - In systems grounded at the transformer or other source of supply, the neutral conductor shall have an outer covering. Neutral conductors not running with a control conductor shall be permitted to be cut short and a marker tape shall be used.\n  - Minimum cable sizes for a corresponding grounding conductor may be integral with the conductors. The termination of the equipment grounding conductor for this cable shall be permitted to be by means of a special type of plug at the connection point of the cable. Types EV, EVE, EVJ, EVJE, EVT, and EVJT with a single-phase load current of 72 A or more at rated voltage shall have a braided shield over the power-carrying conductors. The shield requirements for three-phase cables shall be covered by cable assembly standards.\n  - The required outer covering on some single-conductor cables may be integral with the insulation.

Confirm conduit type (RMC) and size (1¼-inch).  \n2. Verify conductor type (THHN) and size (10 AWG).  \n3. Ensure fill does not exceed 40% for more than two conductors.  \n\n**[OK] Source: NEC 2023 Chapter 9 Tables 4 and 5**",

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

Where shields for these cables are grounded at more than one point, ampacities shall be adjusted to take into consideration the heating due to shield currents.\n\n\nInformational Note: Tables other than those listed contain the ampacity of cables with shields grounded at multiple points.\n\n- (2) Burial Depth. Where the burial depth of direct burial or electrical duct bank circuits is modified from the values shown in a figure or table, ampacities shall be permitted to be modified as indicated in 311.60(D)(2)(a) and (D)(2)(b). No ampacity adjustments shall be required where the burial depth is decreased. ∆\n\n\n(a) Where burial depths are increased in part(s) of an electrical duct run, a decrease in ampacity of the conductors shall not be required, provided the total length of parts of the duct run increased in depth is less than 25 percent of the total run length.\n\n(b) Where burial depths are deeper than shown in a specific underground ampacity table or figure, an ampacity derating factor of 6 percent per 300 mm (1 ft) increase in depth for all values of rho shall be permitted.\n\n- (3) Electrical Ducts Entering Equipment Enclosures. At locations where electrical ducts enter equipment enclosures from underground, spacing between such ducts, as shown in Figure 311.60(D)(3), shall be permitted to be reduced without requiring the ampacity of conductors therein to be reduced.\n\n\n- (4) Ambient Temperature Correction. Ampacities for ambient temperatures other than those specified in the ampacity tables shall be corrected in accordance with Table 311.60(D)(4) or shall be permitted to be calculated using the following equation:\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nI ′ = ampacity corrected for ambient temperature\n\nTc = temperature rating of conductor (°C)\n\nI = ampacity shown in the table for Tc and Ta\n\nT a ′ = new ambient temperature (°C)\n\nTa = ambient temperature used in the table (°C)\n\nResult 4 [CEC 2022 Section 334.80] (relevance: 0.49)\n#### 334.80 Ampacity\n\nThe ampacity of Types NM and NMC cable shall be determined in accordance with 310.14. The ampacity shall not exceed that of a 60°C (140°F) rated conductor. The 90°C (194°F) rating shall be permitted to be used for ampacity adjustment and correction calculations, provided the final calculated ampacity does not exceed that of a 60°C (140°F) rated conductor. The ampacity of Types NM and NMC cable ∆\n\ninstalled in cable trays shall be determined in accordance with 392.80(A).\n\nWhere more than two NM cables containing two or more current-carrying conductors are installed, without maintaining spacing between the cables, through the same opening in wood framing that is to be sealed with thermal insulation, caulk, or sealing foam, the ampacity of each conductor shall be adjusted in accordance with Table 310.15(C)(1) and the provisions of 310.14(A)(2), Exception, shall not apply.\n\nWhere more than two NM cables containing two or more current-carrying conductors are installed in contact with thermal insulation without maintaining spacing between cables, the ampacity of each conductor shall be adjusted in accordance with Table 310.15(C)(1).\n\nResult 5 [CEC 2022 Section 310.14] (relevance: 0.31)\n#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts\n\n\n##### (A) General.\n\n- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n",
