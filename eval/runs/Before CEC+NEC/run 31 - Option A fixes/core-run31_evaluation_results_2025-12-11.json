Over 8 3 /4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.\n\n4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance.

      "answer": "## AFCI Protection Requirements in Dwelling Units (CEC 2022)\n\n### **Why AFCI Protection is Required**\nThe California Electrical Code (CEC 2022), following NEC requirements, mandates **arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI)** protection for 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits in dwelling units (bedrooms, living rooms, etc.) to **prevent electrical fires caused by arc faults** (Section 210.12(A)). \n\n### **Electrical Hazard Prevented**\nAFCIs detect **series arcs** (high-resistance arcs) that occur in damaged or degraded wiring, such as:\n- Frayed or damaged cords\n- Loose connections\n- Overloaded circuits\n- Deteriorated insulation\n\nThese arcs generate **localized high heat** (up to 10,000°F) capable of igniting nearby combustible materials (e.g., wood, fabric). Unlike standard circuit breakers, AFCIs distinguish between harmless arcs (e.g., from switches) and dangerous arcs, interrupting the circuit to prevent fires.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Code Requirements**\n- **Scope**: Applies to all 120V, single-phase circuits in **bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, hallways, etc.** (Section 210.12(A)).\n- **Protection Methods**: Requires one of six approved configurations (e.g., combination-type AFCIs at the panel or outlet branch-circuit AFCIs at the first outlet).\n- **Exceptions**: \n  - Fire alarm circuits in metal raceways (Section 210.12(A) Exception).\n  - Short extensions (≤6 ft) without additional outlets (Section 210.12(D)).\n\n---\n\n### **Technical Basis**\n- **UL 1699 Standard**: Defines AFCI performance requirements to detect arcing faults while avoiding nuisance tripping.\n- **NFPA 70E**: Recognizes arc faults as a leading cause of electrical fires in residential settings.\n\n---\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Section 210.12, UL 1699, and NFPA 70E",

Unlike standard circuit breakers, AFCIs distinguish between harmless arcs (e.g., from switches) and dangerous arcs, interrupting the circuit to prevent fires.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Code Requirements**\n- **Scope**: Applies to all 120V, single-phase circuits in **bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, hallways, etc.** (Section 210.12(A)).\n- **Protection Methods**: Requires one of six approved configurations (e.g., combination-type AFCIs at the panel or outlet branch-circuit AFCIs at the first outlet).\n- **Exceptions**: \n  - Fire alarm circuits in metal raceways (Section 210.12(A) Exception).\n  - Short extensions (≤6 ft) without additional outlets (Section 210.12(D)).\n\n---\n\n### **Technical Basis**\n- **UL 1699 Standard**: Defines AFCI performance requirements to detect arcing faults while avoiding nuisance tripping.\n- **NFPA 70E**: Recognizes arc faults as a leading cause of electrical fires in residential settings.\n\n---\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Section 210.12, UL 1699, and NFPA 70E",
