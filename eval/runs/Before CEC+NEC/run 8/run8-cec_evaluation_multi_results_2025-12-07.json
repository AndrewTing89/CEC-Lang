This does not negate the need for dedicated circuits.  \n  - Example: A cooktop with a plug-and-receptacle connection must still have a dedicated circuit sized per 422.3.  \n\n- **210.52(C) (Receptacle Placement)**:  \n  - Receptacles behind cooktops are exempt from wall-space requirements (Exception in 210.52(C)(1)). This applies to **installation** but does not affect the **readiness** mandate for dedicated circuits.  \n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Reference**  \nNEC 2023 covers **installation standards** (e.g., branch circuit sizing, receptacle placement) but **does not mandate** dedicated circuits or panelboard spaces for electrification. California’s requirements are **stricter**, enforcing infrastructure for future all-electric adoption.  \n\n---\n\n✓ **Sources**: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)  \n✓ **Exceptions Checked**: 422.3, 408.2 (no overriding exceptions found for readiness mandates).",

The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n",

CEC 2022 Requirements**\n- **Section 210.8(A)(6):**  \n  **All 125–250V receptacles in kitchens** serving countertop surfaces **must have GFCI protection**.  \n  - **No exceptions** for refrigerator circuits.  \n  - Applies to **all dwelling units**, including guest rooms with cooking facilities (Section 210.17).  \n\n- **Additional Coverage:**  \n  - GFCI required within **1.8 m (6 ft)** of sink basins (Section 210.8(A)(7)).  \n  - **Title 24/CALGreen** mandates may further restrict exceptions for electrification.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. NEC 2023 Requirements**\n- **Section 210.8(A)(6):**  \n  **GFCI protection required for countertop receptacles** in kitchens.  \n  - **Exception:** Receptacles supplying only a **refrigerator** are **not required** to have GFCI protection.  \n  - Allows GFCI protection at the **feeder level** (Section 215.9).  \n\n- **Limited Scope:**  \n  - Does **not** explicitly require GFCI for **laundry areas** or **peninsular countertops** unless within 6 ft of a sink.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Differences**\n| **Aspect**                | **CEC 2022**                          | **NEC 2023**                          |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Refrigerator Circuits** | **No exception** – GFCI required.     | **Exception** – GFCI not required.    |\n| **Feeder-Level GFCI**     | **Not permitted** (must be at receptacle). | **Allowed** via Section 215.9.        |\n| **Additional Coverage**   | Includes **laundry areas** (Section 210.8(A)(11)). | Narrower scope (focus on kitchens).   |\n\n---\n\n### **4. Which Code is More Restrictive?**\n- **CEC 2022 is more restrictive** because:  \n  1. **No exceptions** for refrigerator circuits in kitchens.  \n  2. **Broader coverage** (e.g., laundry areas, peninsular countertops).  \n  3. **Prohibits feeder-level GFCI** for kitchens, requiring device-level protection.  \n\n- **NEC 2023 offers flexibility** through exceptions and feeder-level GFCI options.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. California-Specific Context**\n- **Title 24 Part 6** and **CALGreen** may further tighten requirements for energy efficiency and electrification in kitchens.  \n- **Enforcement:** California inspectors enforce CEC amendments strictly, even if NEC allows alternatives.  \n\n---\n\n**✓ Sources:** CEC 2022 Sections 210.8, 210.52, 215.9; NEC 2023 Sections 210.8, 215.9.",

CEC 2022 Requirements**\n- **Section 210.8(A)(6):**  \n  **All 125–250V receptacles in kitchens** serving countertop surfaces **must have GFCI protection**.  \n  - **No exceptions** for dedicated appliances (e.g., refrigerators) in kitchens.  \n  - Applies to **all dwelling units**, including guest rooms with cooking facilities (Section 210.17).  \n\n- **Additional Coverage:**  \n  - GFCI protection extends to **within 1.8 m (6 ft)** of sink basins (Section 210.8(A)(7)).  \n  - **Title 24/CALGreen mandates** may further restrict exceptions for electrification in kitchens.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. NEC 2023 Requirements**\n- **Section 210.8(A)(6):**  \n  **GFCI protection required for countertop receptacles** in kitchens.  \n  - **Exception:** Receptacles supplying only a **refrigerator** are **not required** to have GFCI protection (Section 210.8(A)(6) Exception).  \n  - Allows GFCI protection at the **feeder level** (Section 215.9), providing flexibility.  \n\n- **Limited Scope:**  \n  - Does **not** explicitly require GFCI for receptacles in **laundry areas** or **peninsular countertops** unless within 6 ft of a sink.  \n\n---\n\n### **3.

CEC 2022 Requirements**\n- **Section 210.8(A)(6):**  \n  **All 125–250V receptacles in kitchens** serving countertop surfaces **must have GFCI protection**.  \n  - **No exceptions** for refrigerator circuits.  \n  - Applies to **all dwelling units**, including guest rooms with cooking facilities (Section 210.17).  \n\n- **Additional Coverage:**  \n  - GFCI required within **1.8 m (6 ft)** of sink basins (Section 210.8(A)(7)).  \n  - **Title 24/CALGreen** mandates may further restrict exceptions for electrification.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. NEC 2023 Requirements**\n- **Section 210.8(A)(6):**  \n  **GFCI protection required for countertop receptacles** in kitchens.  \n  - **Exception:** Receptacles supplying only a **refrigerator** are **not required** to have GFCI protection.  \n  - Allows GFCI protection at the **feeder level** (Section 215.9).  \n\n- **Limited Scope:**  \n  - Does **not** explicitly require GFCI for **laundry areas** or **peninsular countertops** unless within 6 ft of a sink.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Differences**\n| **Aspect**                | **CEC 2022**                          | **NEC 2023**                          |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Refrigerator Circuits** | **No exception** – GFCI required.     | **Exception** – GFCI not required.    |\n| **Feeder-Level GFCI**     | **Not permitted** (must be at receptacle). | **Allowed** via Section 215.9.        |\n| **Additional Coverage**   | Includes **laundry areas** (Section 210.8(A)(11)). | Narrower scope (focus on kitchens).   |\n\n---\n\n### **4. Which Code is More Restrictive?**\n- **CEC 2022 is more restrictive** because:  \n  1. **No exceptions** for refrigerator circuits in kitchens.  \n  2. **Broader coverage** (e.g., laundry areas, peninsular countertops).  \n  3. **Prohibits feeder-level GFCI** for kitchens, requiring device-level protection.  \n\n- **NEC 2023 offers flexibility** through exceptions and feeder-level GFCI options.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. California-Specific Context**\n- **Title 24 Part 6** and **CALGreen** may further tighten requirements for energy efficiency and electrification in kitchens.  \n- **Enforcement:** California inspectors enforce CEC amendments strictly, even if NEC allows alternatives.  \n\n---\n\n**✓ Sources:** CEC 2022 Sections 210.8, 210.52, 215.9; NEC 2023 Sections 210.8, 215.9.",

It **does not allow exceptions** for ceiling fans/luminaires using locking receptacles.  \n  2. It **requires GFCI for all countertop receptacles**, including those serving dedicated appliances, unless explicitly exempted (which CEC permits).  \n\n- **CEC 2022** provides **specific exceptions** for certain installations (e.g., ceiling fans with locking receptacles), making it less restrictive in those scenarios.  \n\nBoth codes align on core GFCI requirements for kitchens, but NEC extends protection to edge cases where CEC allows exemptions.  \n\n✓ Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",

It **does not allow exceptions** for ceiling fans/luminaires using locking receptacles (CEC allows this exception).  \n  2. It **requires GFCI for all countertop receptacles**, including those serving dedicated appliances, unless explicitly exempted (CEC allows some exceptions).  \n\n- **CEC 2022** provides **specific exceptions** for certain installations (e.g., ceiling fans with locking receptacles), making it slightly less restrictive in those scenarios.  \n\nBoth codes align on the core requirement for GFCI protection of kitchen countertop receptacles. However, NEC 2023 extends GFCI requirements to edge cases where CEC 2022 permits exceptions.  \n\n✓ Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",

It **does not allow exceptions** for ceiling fans/luminaires using locking receptacles.  \n  2. It **requires GFCI for all countertop receptacles**, including those serving dedicated appliances, unless explicitly exempted (which CEC permits).  \n\n- **CEC 2022** provides **specific exceptions** for certain installations (e.g., ceiling fans with locking receptacles), making it less restrictive in those scenarios.  \n\nBoth codes align on core GFCI requirements for kitchens, but NEC extends protection to edge cases where CEC allows exemptions.  \n\n✓ Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",

          "answer": "## AFCI Protection Requirements: CEC 2022 vs NEC 2023 (Final Answer)\n\n### **Core Requirements for Dwelling Units**\nBoth codes require **AFCI protection** for **15- and 20-ampere, 120V branch circuits** in kitchens, family rooms, bedrooms, and similar areas. Protection methods include:\n- **Combination-type AFCI** (entire circuit protection)\n- **Branch/feeder-type AFCI + outlet branch-circuit AFCI**\n- **Supplemental protection + outlet branch-circuit AFCI** (with conductor length limits)\n- **Outlet branch-circuit AFCI** under specific conditions\n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences**\n| **Aspect** | **CEC 2022** | **NEC 2023** |\n|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Concrete/Encasement Exception** | Permits outlet branch-circuit AFCI at first outlet if **50 mm (2 in.) of concrete** encases the circuit between the overcurrent device and first outlet. | No concrete/encasement exception. |\n| **Metal Raceway Exception** | Allows outlet branch-circuit AFCI if wiring uses **metal raceway, MC cable, or Type AC cable** with metal boxes. | No explicit metal raceway exception. |\n| **Fire Alarm Systems** | Exempts circuits for fire alarms installed per **760.41(B) or 760.121(B)** if in metal raceway. | No California-specific exemption. |\n| **Branch Circuit Extensions** | Requires AFCI protection for extensions **>1.8 m (6 ft)** or with additional outlets. | Similar requirement, no specific length exception. |\n\n---\n\n### **Exceptions in CEC 2022**\n1. **Fire Alarm Systems**: AFCI not required for circuits supplying fire alarms in metal raceway (per 760.41(B)/760.121(B)).\n2. **Concrete/Encasement**: Permits simplified AFCI methods for circuits encased in ≥2 in. concrete.\n3. **Metal Raceway**: Allows outlet branch-circuit AFCI with metal raceway systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Code Citations**\n- **CEC 2022**: [210.12(A)](https://www.example.com/cec210.12), [210.12(A)(5)](https://www.example.com/cec210.12)\n- **NEC 2023**: [210.12](https://www.example.com/nec210.12), [404.22(C)(4)](https://www.example.com/nec404.22)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThe **CEC 2022** includes **California-specific exceptions** for **concrete-encased** and **metal raceway** installations, allowing simplified AFCI protection methods not permitted under the **NEC 2023**. Both codes align on core AFCI protection methods but differ in handling special cases like fire alarm systems and circuit extensions. Always verify local amendments for compliance. \n\n✓ Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",
