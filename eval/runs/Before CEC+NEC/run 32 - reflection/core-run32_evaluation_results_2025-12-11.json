However, **best practices** and manufacturer recommendations often suggest installing surge protective devices (SPDs) to protect sensitive equipment.\n\n### Key Code References:\n1. **CEC 2022 Section 250.6** mentions surge arresters in the context of preventing objectionable currents but does not mandate their installation for residential services.\n2. **No specific CEC section** requires SPDs for residential services, unlike some NEC articles (e.g., NEC 230.67 for commercial systems).\n\n### Recommended Installation Locations:\nIf surge protection is installed, it should be placed:\n- **At the main service panel** (near the service disconnect) to protect the entire electrical system.\n- **At critical loads** (e.g., HVAC systems, data centers, or home offices) for additional protection.\n\n### Grounding Requirements:\n- SPDs must be **properly grounded** per CEC grounding rules (e.g., Section 250.24 for service grounding).\n- Use an equipment grounding conductor sized per **Table 250.122** (e.g., 6 AWG copper for a 200A service).\n\n### Inspector Note:\nWhile not code-mandated, surge protection is **highly recommended** for modern homes with sensitive electronics. Always follow the SPD manufacturer’s installation instructions and ensure compliance with CEC grounding and bonding requirements.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Key details:\n- **Arc faults** occur due to damaged wiring, loose connections, or deteriorated insulation.\n- Unlike standard circuit breakers (which respond to overcurrents), AFCIs detect **series arcs** (e.g., frayed cords) and **parallel arcs** (e.g., damaged insulation causing short circuits).\n- Arcs can generate **temperatures exceeding 10,000°F**, igniting nearby combustible materials (e.g., wood, fabric).\n\n---\n\n### **Why Bedrooms and Living Areas?**\nThese areas are high-risk due to:\n- Frequent use of **extension cords** and power strips.\n- **Damaged or aged wiring** in walls or ceilings.\n- **Loose connections** in outlets or switches.\n- **Overloaded circuits** from multiple devices.\n\nAFCIs address these risks by **interrupting the circuit** before an arc can cause a fire, even if the current remains within normal levels.\n\n---\n\n### **AFCI Implementation Options**\nSection 210.12(A) permits six methods for AFCI protection, including:\n1. **Combination-type AFCI** at the panel (most common).\n2. **Branch/feeder-type AFCI** combined with outlet AFCIs.\n3. **Supplemental arc protection** with outlet AFCIs (under specific conditions).\n\n---\n\n### **Inspector Note**\n- **GFCI vs. AFCI**: GFCI (Section 210.8) protects against **shock hazards** (ground faults), while AFCI protects against **fire hazards** (arc faults). They serve different purposes and are often required in the same circuits.\n- **Compliance**: Verify AFCI protection is installed **at the first outlet** of the circuit or via a combination-type AFCI at the panel.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Section 210.12",
