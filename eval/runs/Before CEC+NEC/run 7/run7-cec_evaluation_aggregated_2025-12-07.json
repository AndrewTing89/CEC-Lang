This requirement is specified in **CEC 2022 Section 422.3**, with specific mandates for both single-family and multifamily dwellings:  \n\n1. **Single-Family Homes (1-2 units):**  \n   - **Dedicated circuits and circuit identification** for electric cooktops must be provided per **California Energy Code Section 150.0(u)**.  \n   - This includes pre-wiring with appropriate branch circuits and designated spaces for future installation.  \n\n2. **Multifamily Homes (3+ units):**  \n   - **Dedicated circuits and circuit identification** for electric cooktops are required per **California Energy Code Section 160.9(b)**.  \n   - This ensures each dwelling unit has the necessary electrical infrastructure for an electric cooktop, even if not immediately installed.  \n\n**Key Exceptions and Considerations:**  \n- **Section 422.23 (Other Installation Methods):**  \n  If non-standard installation methods are used (e.g., cord-and-plug connections for cooktops), **special permission** is required. This does not override the readiness requirement but adds a compliance pathway for alternative installations.  \n\n- **Section 422.33 (Disconnection Methods):**  \n  For cord-and-plug-connected cooktops, receptacles must meet the appliance’s rating. However, **demand factors** (e.g., load calculations) may be applied to receptacle ratings where permitted elsewhere in the code. This affects circuit design but does not negate the need for pre-wired circuits.  \n\n**NEC 2023 Reference**  \nThe **NEC 2023** does not mandate \"readiness\" for electric cooktops in new homes. While it requires proper circuit sizing for installed appliances (e.g., 422.11), it does not require pre-wiring or dedicated circuits for future electric cooktops absent an installed appliance.  \n\n**Difference from CEC:**  \nCalifornia’s requirement goes beyond the NEC by ensuring new homes are electrically prepared for electric cooktops, aligninging with state energy efficiency and decarbonization goals.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

Permitted Uses for Type MV Cable (CEC 311.32)**\n- **Exception**: Type MV cable is permitted for systems rated up to 35,000 volts in wet/dry locations, raceways, cable trays, and exposed runs.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - Tables like **315.60(C)(5)-(13)** (ampacities for MV cables) apply only if installation complies with these permitted uses.  \n  - For example, if cables are installed in cable trays (as in Table 315.60(C)(13)), **Article 392** requirements (cable tray installation) must also be followed.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC does not explicitly permit these specific configurations for MV cables in cable trays or isolated conduits.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Shielding Requirements (CEC 311.44)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Nonshielded MV cables up to 2400 volts are allowed in industrial facilities with qualified personnel.  \n  - Above 2000 volts, cables must be shielded and grounded.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - Tables specifying ampacities (e.g., **315.10(A)**) assume cables meet shielding requirements. Noncompliant shielding could invalidate table values.  \n  - Direct-burial cables (Table 315.60(C)(10)) must comply with grounding rules in **311.44**.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC requires shielding for all MV cables above 2000 volts, making CEC’s industrial exception unique.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Direct-Burial Conductors (CEC 311.36)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Shielded MV cables must be grounded per **300.50** for direct burial.  \n  - Nonshielded cables (2001–2400V) are allowed if armored or sheathed.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - Tables like **315.60(C)(10)** (direct-burial ampacities) apply only if cables meet these grounding and shielding rules.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC does not permit nonshielded MV cables for direct burial, making this a California-specific allowance.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Type MI and MC Cable Uses (CEC 332.10 & 330.10)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Type MI (mineral-insulated) and MC (metal-clad) cables are permitted in hazardous locations, aerial installations, and wet/dry environments.  \n  - MC cables in wet locations require corrosion-resistant jackets.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - These exceptions expand the applicability of tables like **315.60(C)(5)** (air ampacities) to include MC/MI cables in specific environments.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC restricts MC/MI cables to fewer locations (e.g., no aerial use), making CEC’s broader permitted uses unique.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Airfield Lighting and Industrial Exceptions (CEC 311.36, 311.44)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Airfield lighting cables up to 5000V may be nonshielded.  \n  - Industrial facilities can use nonshielded cables up to 5000V with qualified personnel.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - These exceptions allow deviations from standard shielding requirements in tables for specialized applications.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC does not permit nonshielded MV cables in airfield or industrial settings without additional approvals.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer: CEC 2022 Medium Voltage Cable Tables (California-Specific)\n\nThe **CEC 2022** includes the following medium voltage cable tables **not found in the NEC 2023**:\n\n1. **Table 315.10(A)**: Conductor application and insulation for ≥2001V.  \n2. **Table 315.60(C)(5)-(13)**: Ampacities for three-conductor copper/aluminum cables in air, conduit, and underground ducts.  \n\n### **Key Exceptions Affecting These Tables**:\n- **Shielding/Grounding**: Required for cables >2000V (CEC 311.44).  \n- **Direct-Burial**: Requires shielding and grounding (CEC 311.36).  \n- **Permitted Uses**: Expanded for MC/MI cables in hazardous/aerial locations (CEC 330.10, 332.10).  \n\n### **NEC 2023 Reference**  \nThese tables and exceptions are **exclusive to the CEC**, reflecting California’s tailored approach to medium voltage cable applications.

All PV systems ≥80V DC require DC arc-fault protection regardless of installation type.\n\n---\n\n### **Updated Comparison Summary**\n\n#### 1. **Arc-Fault Protection (690.11)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - **Exception for non-building systems** (e.g., ground-mounted arrays in metallic conduit).\n  - Detached structures (e.g., PV racking enclosures) excluded from \"building\" definition.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - **No exception** for non-building installations. All systems ≥80V DC must have DC arc-fault protection.\n- **Impact:** California allows cost savings for ground-mounted systems using metallic raceways, while NEC requires protection regardless of installation.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Hybrid System Compliance (690.59)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Requires compliance with **Article 705 (Energy Systems)** and **Article 712 (Fuel Cell Systems)** for PV systems connected to other sources.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Only references **Article 705** for interconnection. No mention of fuel cell systems (Article 712).\n- **Difference:** CEC mandates additional compliance with fuel cell standards (Article 712), which NEC does not.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Energy Storage Systems (690.71)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Requires compliance with **Article 706 (Energy Storage Systems)**.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - No direct reference to energy storage in Article 690.\n- **Difference:** CEC explicitly integrates energy storage requirements via Article 706.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Stand-Alone Systems (690.10)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - References **Article 710 (Stand-Alone Systems)** for installation.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Includes stand-alone requirements directly in Article 690.\n- **Difference:** CEC separates stand-alone systems into a dedicated article.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **AC Modules (690.6)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Treats AC modules as internal components, exempting them from standard PV source circuit rules.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Similar treatment but lacks CEC's explicit \"internal components\" language.\n- **Difference:** CEC provides clearer exemptions for AC module internal components.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-Reference Compliance**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Cross-references **Articles 705, 706, 710, and 712**, creating a more integrated code framework for hybrid and storage systems.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Lacks explicit cross-references to fuel cell (712) and energy storage (706) standards in Article 690.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Determination**\nCalifornia's CEC 2022 introduces **three key modifications** to NEC 2023 Article 690:\n1. **Exception for non-building PV systems** using metallic raceways (690.11).\n2. **Mandatory compliance with Articles 705, 706, and 712** for hybrid systems.\n3. **Dedicated Article 710** for stand-alone systems.\n\nThese amendments reflect California's emphasis on **system integration**, **safety in non-traditional installations**, and **energy storage compliance**.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",
