The overcurrent devices shall be accessible but shall not be required to be readily accessible. ∆\nInformational Note:  Due to improved ground-fault protection  required  in  PV  systems  by  690.41(B),  a  single overcurrent  protective  device  in  either  the  positive  or negative conductors of a PV system in combination with this ground-fault protection provides adequate overcurrent protection.\n(D)  Power Transformers. Overcurrent protection for a transformer  with  a  source(s)  on  each  side  shall  be  provided  in accordance with 450.3 by considering first one side of the transformer, then the other side of the transformer, as the primary.\nException:  A power transformer with a current rating on the side connected toward the interactive inverter output, not less than the rated continuous output current of the inverter, shall be permitted without overcurrent protection from the inverter.\n",

This ensures future-ready wiring compliance with California Energy Code Section 150.0(n).\n\n2. **Branch Circuit Requirements:**  \n   **CEC 2022 Section 422.3(A)** mandates that each dwelling unit must have **designated branch circuits and circuit identifications** for heat pump water heaters. This includes proper labeling and dedicated circuits as specified by the California Energy Code.\n\n3. **Application Scope:**  \n   These requirements apply to **single-family residential buildings** with one or two dwellings. Multifamily buildings follow different provisions (not applicable here).\n\n**Exceptions Checked:**  \n- Searched exceptions for **CEC 2022 Section 408.2** (panelboards in single-family buildings).  \n- Found exceptions related to **enclosures**, **overcurrent protection**, and **grounding** (Sections 408.38, 408.36, 408.40).  \n- **No exceptions apply** to the heat pump water heater circuit requirements in 408.2(A) or 422.3(A).  \n\n**Key CEC Citations:**  \n- CEC 2022 Sections 408.2(A), 422.3(A)  \n- California Energy Code Sections 150.0(n) (referenced but not included in CEC text)\n\n---\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \nThe base NEC 2023 does not explicitly require **future-ready dedicated circuits** for heat pump water heaters. While NEC 422.12 covers central heating equipment, California’s CEC adds specific readiness provisions for energy-efficient appliances not found in the national code.  \n\n**Difference Summary:**  \n- **CEC:** Requires pre-wiring and dedicated spaces for heat pump water heaters in new dwellings (energy code-driven).  \n- **NEC:** No equivalent requirement for future-ready circuits for this specific appliance.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

Over 8 3 /4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.\n\n4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.\n\n5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 1 3 /4 kW and used in instructional programs.\n\nTable 220.56 Demand Factors for Kitchen Equipment - Other Than Dwelling Unit(s)\n\n\n##### (B) General Loads.

For ranges individually rated more than 12 kW but not more than 27 kW, the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each additional kilowatt of rating or major fraction thereof by which the rating of individual ranges exceeds 12 kW.\n\n2. Over 8 3 /4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.\n\n4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.\n\n5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 1 3 /4 kW and used in instructional programs.\n\nTable 220.56 Demand Factors for Kitchen Equipment - Other Than Dwelling Unit(s)\n\n\n##### (B) General Loads. The general calculated load shall be not less than 100 percent of the first 10 kV A plus 40 percent of the remainder of the following loads:\n\n\n- (1) 33 volt-amperes/m 2 or 3 volt-amperes/ft 2 for general lighting and general-use receptacles. The floor area for each floor shall be calculated from the outside dimensions of the dwelling unit. The calculated floor area shall not include open porches, garages, or unused or unfinished spaces not adaptable for future use.\n\n- (2) 1500  volt-amperes for each 2-wire, 20-ampere smallappliance branch circuit and each laundry branch circuit covered in 210.11(C)(1) and (C)(2).\n\n- (3) The nameplate rating of the following:\n\n- a.

          "answer": "## Electric Cooktop Readiness in New California Homes (CEC 2022)  \n\n**California Requirement (CEC 2022):**  \nNew residential buildings in California must include **electric cooktop readiness** as part of their electrical design. This requirement is specified in **CEC 2022 Section 422.3**, with specific mandates for both single-family and multifamily dwellings:  \n\n1. **Single-Family Homes (1-2 units):**  \n   - **Dedicated circuits and circuit identification** for electric cooktops must be provided per **California Energy Code Section 150.0(u)**.  \n   - This includes pre-wiring with appropriate branch circuits and designated spaces for future installation.  \n\n2. **Multifamily Homes (3+ units):**  \n   - **Dedicated circuits and circuit identification** for electric cooktops are required per **California Energy Code Section 160.9(b)**.  \n   - This ensures each dwelling unit has the necessary electrical infrastructure for an electric cooktop, even if not immediately installed.  \n\n**Key Exceptions and Considerations:**  \n- **Section 422.23 (Other Installation Methods):**  \n  If non-standard installation methods are used (e.g., cord-and-plug connections for cooktops), **special permission** is required. This does not override the readiness requirement but adds a compliance pathway for alternative installations.  \n\n- **Section 422.33 (Disconnection Methods):**  \n  For cord-and-plug-connected cooktops, receptacles must meet the appliance’s rating. However, **demand factors** (e.g., load calculations) may be applied to receptacle ratings where permitted elsewhere in the code. This affects circuit design but does not negate the need for pre-wired circuits.  \n\n**NEC 2023 Reference**  \nThe **NEC 2023** does not mandate \"readiness\" for electric cooktops in new homes. While it requires proper circuit sizing for installed appliances (e.g., 422.11), it does not require pre-wiring or dedicated circuits for future electric cooktops absent an installed appliance.  \n\n**Difference from CEC:**  \nCalifornia’s requirement goes beyond the NEC by ensuring new homes are electrically prepared for electric cooktops, aligninging with state energy efficiency and decarbonization goals.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

For ranges individually rated more than 12 kW but not more than 27 kW, the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each additional kilowatt of rating or major fraction thereof by which the rating of individual ranges exceeds 12 kW.\n\n2. Over 8 3 /4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.\n\n4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.\n\n5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 1 3 /4 kW and used in instructional programs.\n\nTable 220.56 Demand Factors for Kitchen Equipment - Other Than Dwelling Unit(s)\n\n\n##### (B) General Loads. The general calculated load shall be not less than 100 percent of the first 10 kV A plus 40 percent of the remainder of the following loads:\n\n\n- (1) 33 volt-amperes/m 2 or 3 volt-amperes/ft 2 for general lighting and general-use receptacles. The floor area for each floor shall be calculated from the outside dimensions of the dwelling unit. The calculated floor area shall not include open porches, garages, or unused or unfinished spaces not adaptable for future use.\n\n- (2) 1500  volt-amperes for each 2-wire, 20-ampere smallappliance branch circuit and each laundry branch circuit covered in 210.11(C)(1) and (C)(2).\n\n- (3) The nameplate rating of the following:\n\n- a. All appliances that are fastened in place, permanently connected, or located to be on a specific circuit\n- b. Ranges, wall-mounted ovens, counter-mounted cooking units\n- c. Clothes dryers that are not connected to the laundry branch circuit specified in item (2)\n- d. Water heaters\n- (4) The nameplate ampere or kVA rating of all permanently connected motors not included in item (3).\n\n\n##### (C) Heating and Air-Conditioning Load. The largest of the following six selections (load in kV A) shall be included:\n\n\n- (1) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the air conditioning and cooling.\n\n- (2) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump when the heat pump is used without any supplemental electric heating.\n\n- (3) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump compressor and 65 percent of the supplemental electric heating for central electric space-heating systems. If the heat pump compressor is prevented from operating at the same time as the supplementary heat, it does not need to be added to the supplementary heat for the total central space heating load.\n\n- (4) 65 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if less than four separately controlled units.\n\n- (5) 40 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if four or more separately controlled units.\n\n- (6) 100  percent of the nameplate ratings of electric thermal storage and other heating systems where the usual load is\n\n\nexpected to be continuous at the full nameplate value. Systems qualifying under this selection shall not be calculated under any other selection in 220.82(C).\n",

This ensures readiness for future dryer installation.\n\n2. **Multifamily Buildings**:  \n   Panelboards must include **dedicated circuits** for dryers per **California Energy Code Section 160.9(c)**. This applies to each dwelling unit.\n\n**Exceptions Checked:**  \n- No exceptions to Sections 408.2 or 422.3 override the requirement for dedicated dryer spaces.  \n- Cross-referenced exceptions (e.g., 210.52(F) for laundry receptacles, 408.40 for grounding) do **not modify** the panelboard pre-wiring mandate for dryers.\n\n**Key Details:**  \n- **No specific ampacity** is listed in the CEC text for dryers (see NEC 440.62 for typical 30A 240V circuits).  \n- **Pre-wiring requirement**: California mandates panelboard readiness even if the dryer is not immediately installed.\n\n---\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \nThe base NEC requires a **240V circuit** for dryers (NEC 210.21(B)(2)), typically sized at **30A**.

This applies to high-rise buildings where standard NEC rules would otherwise apply.\n\n2. **Motor-Operated Appliances (422.12):**  \n   - **CEC 230.90 Exception 4** permits grouped circuit breakers (up to six) for multifamily laundry equipment, with combined ratings exceeding conductor ampacity, provided calculated loads comply. This aligns with Table 240.4(G) entries for motor-operated appliance circuits.\n\n3. **Capacitor Circuits (460.25):**  \n   - **CEC 460.25(D)** adds a delta requirement that protective devices must operate within the \"safe zone\" defined by capacitor manufacturer specifications.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nCEC Table 240.4(G) retains the NEC structure but includes **delta [Δ] notes** directing inspectors to California-specific exceptions in sections like 370.23, 230.90, and 460.25.

For example:\n   - **Fire alarm systems**: California may impose stricter overcurrent protection rules for fire alarm circuits (760.43/45) compared to NEC.\n   - **Motor circuits**: CEC could adjust motor overload protection requirements in 430.32 to align with California energy efficiency standards.\n\n2. **Additional References**: California might add localized requirements not present in NEC. For instance:\n   - **Solar PV systems**: While not explicitly listed, California’s amendments to Article 690 (PV systems) may indirectly affect overcurrent protection for related conductors.\n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Comparison**\n- **No structural differences**: The table format and most references match NEC 2023 Table 240.4(G).\n- **California amendments**: The [CEC] deltas indicate localized modifications to referenced sections (e.g., stricter fire alarm requirements in 760.43).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nCEC Table 240.4(G) is functionally identical to NEC 2023 Table 240.4(G) in structure and most references. California’s unique contributions are limited to:\n1. **Delta amendments** to referenced sections (e.g., fire alarm systems).\n2. **Implicit local rules** in articles like 690 (PV) that affect overcurrent protection indirectly.\n\nFor enforceable California requirements, always follow the [CEC] deltas and cross-reference with the cited NEC sections.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

These are located in **Section 311.60(C)(67) through 311.60(C)(86)** and address unique installation scenarios:\n\n---\n\n### **Key CEC Tables Not in NEC**\n| Table ID | Application | Unique CEC Features |\n|----------|-------------|---------------------|\n| **311.60(C)(67–76)** | Triplexed/Isolated MV Cables in Air | - Ampacities for copper/aluminum conductors in air<br>- Specific to 3-conductor or triplexed configurations |\n| **311.60(C)(77–80)** | Underground Ducts | - 3-conductor cables in electrical ducts<br>- Differentiates copper vs. aluminum |\n| **311.60(C)(81–86)** | Direct Burial | - Single and 3-conductor cables buried directly<br>- Includes depth/soil thermal resistance adjustments |\n\n---\n\n### **California-Specific Requirements**\n1. **Cable Tray Adjustments**  \n   - **Section 392.80**:  \n     - **Covered trays**: Limit ampacities to **95% of table values** for multiconductor cables.  \n     - **Burial depth corrections**: 6% ampacity reduction per 1 ft (300 mm) depth increase for direct-buried cables.  \n     - **Example**: 600 kcmil+ cables in covered trays limited to **70% of Table 310.17/19 values**.\n\n2. **Shield Grounding Impact**  \n   - **Section 311.60(D)(1)**:  \n     - Cables with shields grounded at >1 point require ampacity adjustments for circulating shield currents (not in NEC).\n\n3. **Direct-Burial Exceptions**  \n   - **Section 311.36**:  \n     - Nonshielded multiconductor cables rated 2001–2400V permitted **with metallic sheath/armor**.  \n     - Airfield lighting cables allowed to be nonshielded under FAA guidelines.\n\n---\n\n### **Exceptions Affecting Application**\n1. **Ampacity Selection**  \n   - **Exception to 311.60(A)(2)**:  \n     - Higher ampacity allowed for short circuit segments (≤10 ft or 10% of total length).  \n\n2. **Shielding Requirements**  \n   - **Section 311.44**:  \n     - Nonshielded conductors permitted up to 5000V in industrial facilities with qualified personnel.  \n     - Shielded cables required for voltages >2000V in non-industrial settings.\n\n3. **Direct-Burial Construction**  \n   - **Section 311.36**:  \n     - Nonshielded cables allowed in wet locations **with metallic sheath/armor**.\n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Comparison**\n- **NEC 2023** covers MV cables generically in **Article 300** and **Table 310.6** but:\n  - Lacks **installation-specific tables** for triplexed cables, underground ducts, or direct burial.\n  - Does not include **depth/spacing correction factors** found in CEC 311.60(D).\n  - Shield grounding adjustments are not addressed.\n\n---\n\n### **Example CEC Table: 311.60(C)(81)**\n**Ampacities of Single Insulated Copper Conductors Directly Buried**  \n- Includes columns for:\n  - Conductor size (250 kcmil–2000 kcmil)\n  - Soil thermal resistivity (°C·cm/W)\n  - Burial depth adjustments\n  - Shielded vs. unshielded cables\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nCalifornia's CEC 2022 provides **detailed, installation-specific MV cable tables** (311.60(C)(67–86)) and derating rules not present in NEC 2023. These address:\n- Unique cable configurations (triplexed, ducts, direct burial)\n- Depth/spacing corrections\n- Shield grounding effects\n\n**NEC 2023 Reference:**  \nNo direct equivalent tables exist. General MV provisions are in **Article 300**, but lack California's detailed derating and installation-specific requirements.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

These are located in **Section 311.60(C)(67) through 311.60(C)(86)** and address unique installation scenarios:\n\n---\n\n### **Key CEC Tables Not in NEC**\n| Table ID | Application | Unique CEC Features |\n|----------|-------------|---------------------|\n| **311.60(C)(67–76)** | Triplexed/Isolated MV Cables in Air | - Ampacities for copper/aluminum conductors in air<br>- Specific to 3-conductor or triplexed configurations |\n| **311.60(C)(77–80)** | Underground Ducts | - 3-conductor cables in electrical ducts<br>- Differentiates copper vs. aluminum |\n| **311.60(C)(81–86)** | Direct Burial | - Single and 3-conductor cables buried directly<br>- Includes depth/soil thermal resistance adjustments |\n\n---\n\n### **California-Specific Requirements**\n1. **Cable Tray Adjustments**  \n   - **Section 392.80**:  \n     - **Covered trays**: Limit ampacities to **95% of table values** for multiconductor cables.  \n     - **Burial depth corrections**: 6% ampacity reduction per 1 ft (300 mm) depth increase for direct-buried cables.  \n     - **Example**: 600 kcmil+ cables in covered trays limited to **70% of Table 310.17/19 values**.\n\n2. **Shield Grounding Impact**  \n   - **Section 311.60(D)(1)**:  \n     - Cables with shields grounded at >1 point require ampacity adjustments for circulating shield currents (not in NEC).\n\n3. **Direct-Burial Exceptions**  \n   - **Section 311.36**:  \n     - Nonshielded multiconductor cables rated 2001–2400V permitted **with metallic sheath/armor**.  \n     - Airfield lighting cables allowed to be nonshielded under FAA guidelines.\n\n---\n\n### **Exceptions Affecting Application**\n1. **Ampacity Selection**  \n   - **Exception to 311.60(A)(2)**:  \n     - Higher ampacity allowed for short circuit segments (≤10 ft or 10% of total length).  \n\n2. **Shielding Requirements**  \n   - **Section 311.44**:  \n     - Nonshielded conductors permitted up to 5000V in industrial facilities with qualified personnel.  \n     - Shielded cables required for voltages >2000V in non-industrial settings.\n\n3. **Direct-Burial Construction**  \n   - **Section 311.36**:  \n     - Nonshielded cables allowed in wet locations **with metallic sheath/armor**.\n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Comparison**\n- **NEC 2023** covers MV cables generically in **Article 300** and **Table 310.6** but:\n  - Lacks **installation-specific tables** for triplexed cables, underground ducts, or direct burial.\n  - Does not include **depth/spacing correction factors** found in CEC 311.60(D).\n  - Shield grounding adjustments are not addressed.\n\n---\n\n### **Example CEC Table: 311.60(C)(81)**\n**Ampacities of Single Insulated Copper Conductors Directly Buried**  \n- Includes columns for:\n  - Conductor size (250 kcmil–2000 kcmil)\n  - Soil thermal resistivity (°C·cm/W)\n  - Burial depth adjustments\n  - Shielded vs. unshielded cables\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nCalifornia's CEC 2022 provides **detailed, installation-specific MV cable tables** (311.60(C)(67–86)) and derating rules not present in NEC 2023. These address:\n- Unique cable configurations (triplexed, ducts, direct burial)\n- Depth/spacing corrections\n- Shield grounding effects\n\n**NEC 2023 Reference:**  \nNo direct equivalent tables exist. General MV provisions are in **Article 300**, but lack California's detailed derating and installation-specific requirements.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

          "answer": "## Exceptions and Special Conditions for Medium Voltage Cable Tables in CEC 2022\n\nAfter reviewing the exceptions related to medium voltage (MV) cable applications in the **California Electrical Code (CEC) 2022**, the following key exceptions and special conditions apply to the tables identified earlier:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Permitted Uses for Type MV Cable (CEC 311.32)**\n- **Exception**: Type MV cable is permitted for systems rated up to 35,000 volts in wet/dry locations, raceways, cable trays, and exposed runs.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - Tables like **315.60(C)(5)-(13)** (ampacities for MV cables) apply only if installation complies with these permitted uses.  \n  - For example, if cables are installed in cable trays (as in Table 315.60(C)(13)), **Article 392** requirements (cable tray installation) must also be followed.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC does not explicitly permit these specific configurations for MV cables in cable trays or isolated conduits.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Shielding Requirements (CEC 311.44)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Nonshielded MV cables up to 2400 volts are allowed in industrial facilities with qualified personnel.  \n  - Above 2000 volts, cables must be shielded and grounded.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - Tables specifying ampacities (e.g., **315.10(A)**) assume cables meet shielding requirements. Noncompliant shielding could invalidate table values.  \n  - Direct-burial cables (Table 315.60(C)(10)) must comply with grounding rules in **311.44**.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC requires shielding for all MV cables above 2000 volts, making CEC’s industrial exception unique.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Direct-Burial Conductors (CEC 311.36)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Shielded MV cables must be grounded per **300.50** for direct burial.  \n  - Nonshielded cables (2001–2400V) are allowed if armored or sheathed.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - Tables like **315.60(C)(10)** (direct-burial ampacities) apply only if cables meet these grounding and shielding rules.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC does not permit nonshielded MV cables for direct burial, making this a California-specific allowance.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Type MI and MC Cable Uses (CEC 332.10 & 330.10)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Type MI (mineral-insulated) and MC (metal-clad) cables are permitted in hazardous locations, aerial installations, and wet/dry environments.  \n  - MC cables in wet locations require corrosion-resistant jackets.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - These exceptions expand the applicability of tables like **315.60(C)(5)** (air ampacities) to include MC/MI cables in specific environments.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC restricts MC/MI cables to fewer locations (e.g., no aerial use), making CEC’s broader permitted uses unique.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Airfield Lighting and Industrial Exceptions (CEC 311.36, 311.44)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Airfield lighting cables up to 5000V may be nonshielded.  \n  - Industrial facilities can use nonshielded cables up to 5000V with qualified personnel.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - These exceptions allow deviations from standard shielding requirements in tables for specialized applications.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC does not permit nonshielded MV cables in airfield or industrial settings without additional approvals.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer: CEC 2022 Medium Voltage Cable Tables (California-Specific)\n\nThe **CEC 2022** includes the following medium voltage cable tables **not found in the NEC 2023**:\n\n1. **Table 315.10(A)**: Conductor application and insulation for ≥2001V.  \n2. **Table 315.60(C)(5)-(13)**: Ampacities for three-conductor copper/aluminum cables in air, conduit, and underground ducts.  \n\n### **Key Exceptions Affecting These Tables**:\n- **Shielding/Grounding**: Required for cables >2000V (CEC 311.44).  \n- **Direct-Burial**: Requires shielding and grounding (CEC 311.36).  \n- **Permitted Uses**: Expanded for MC/MI cables in hazardous/aerial locations (CEC 330.10, 332.10).  \n\n### **NEC 2023 Reference**  \nThese tables and exceptions are **exclusive to the CEC**, reflecting California’s tailored approach to medium voltage cable applications. The NEC lacks equivalent tables and permits fewer installation scenarios.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

                "llm_content": "## Exceptions and Special Conditions for Medium Voltage Cable Tables in CEC 2022\n\nAfter reviewing the exceptions related to medium voltage (MV) cable applications in the **California Electrical Code (CEC) 2022**, the following key exceptions and special conditions apply to the tables identified earlier:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Permitted Uses for Type MV Cable (CEC 311.32)**\n- **Exception**: Type MV cable is permitted for systems rated up to 35,000 volts in wet/dry locations, raceways, cable trays, and exposed runs.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - Tables like **315.60(C)(5)-(13)** (ampacities for MV cables) apply only if installation complies with these permitted uses.  \n  - For example, if cables are installed in cable trays (as in Table 315.60(C)(13)), **Article 392** requirements (cable tray installation) must also be followed.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC does not explicitly permit these specific configurations for MV cables in cable trays or isolated conduits.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Shielding Requirements (CEC 311.44)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Nonshielded MV cables up to 2400 volts are allowed in industrial facilities with qualified personnel.  \n  - Above 2000 volts, cables must be shielded and grounded.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - Tables specifying ampacities (e.g., **315.10(A)**) assume cables meet shielding requirements. Noncompliant shielding could invalidate table values.  \n  - Direct-burial cables (Table 315.60(C)(10)) must comply with grounding rules in **311.44**.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC requires shielding for all MV cables above 2000 volts, making CEC’s industrial exception unique.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Direct-Burial Conductors (CEC 311.36)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Shielded MV cables must be grounded per **300.50** for direct burial.  \n  - Nonshielded cables (2001–2400V) are allowed if armored or sheathed.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - Tables like **315.60(C)(10)** (direct-burial ampacities) apply only if cables meet these grounding and shielding rules.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC does not permit nonshielded MV cables for direct burial, making this a California-specific allowance.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Type MI and MC Cable Uses (CEC 332.10 & 330.10)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Type MI (mineral-insulated) and MC (metal-clad) cables are permitted in hazardous locations, aerial installations, and wet/dry environments.  \n  - MC cables in wet locations require corrosion-resistant jackets.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - These exceptions expand the applicability of tables like **315.60(C)(5)** (air ampacities) to include MC/MI cables in specific environments.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC restricts MC/MI cables to fewer locations (e.g., no aerial use), making CEC’s broader permitted uses unique.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Airfield Lighting and Industrial Exceptions (CEC 311.36, 311.44)**\n- **Exception**:  \n  - Airfield lighting cables up to 5000V may be nonshielded.  \n  - Industrial facilities can use nonshielded cables up to 5000V with qualified personnel.  \n- **Impact on Tables**:  \n  - These exceptions allow deviations from standard shielding requirements in tables for specialized applications.  \n- **NEC Comparison**: The NEC does not permit nonshielded MV cables in airfield or industrial settings without additional approvals.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer: CEC 2022 Medium Voltage Cable Tables (California-Specific)\n\nThe **CEC 2022** includes the following medium voltage cable tables **not found in the NEC 2023**:\n\n1. **Table 315.10(A)**: Conductor application and insulation for ≥2001V.  \n2. **Table 315.60(C)(5)-(13)**: Ampacities for three-conductor copper/aluminum cables in air, conduit, and underground ducts.  \n\n### **Key Exceptions Affecting These Tables**:\n- **Shielding/Grounding**: Required for cables >2000V (CEC 311.44).  \n- **Direct-Burial**: Requires shielding and grounding (CEC 311.36).  \n- **Permitted Uses**: Expanded for MC/MI cables in hazardous/aerial locations (CEC 330.10, 332.10).  \n\n### **NEC 2023 Reference**  \nThese tables and exceptions are **exclusive to the CEC**, reflecting California’s tailored approach to medium voltage cable applications. The NEC lacks equivalent tables and permits fewer installation scenarios.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

These enclosures ensure:\n  - Protection against rain, sleet, and ice accumulation\n  - Operable mechanisms even when ice-covered\n  - Corrosion resistance (for SX, 4X, 6P variants)\n\n**Exceptions and Additional Requirements:**\n1. **Section 366.10** permits sheet metal or nonmetallic auxiliary gutters in wet locations if listed for such use. This applies if the installation involves auxiliary gutters rather than direct electrical enclosures.\n2. **Section 110.26(E)** adds critical outdoor installation requirements:\n   - Enclosures must be **identified for outdoor use** (per manufacturer marking)\n   - Must be protected from:\n     - Accidental contact (personnel/vehicles)\n     - Spillage/leakage from piping systems\n     - Environmental damage (e.g., corrosion)\n   - Working clearance space must comply with 110.26(A)\n\n**Key Footnote:**  \nThe table explicitly requires mechanisms to remain operable when ice-covered, aligning with 110.26(E)'s emphasis on outdoor durability.\n\nNo exceptions to the enclosure type ratings in Table 110.28 were found. The listed types remain enforceable for the specified conditions.\n\n---\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \nNo difference from NEC 2023.

Table 400.5(A)(1) provides the ampacities, and Table 400.5(A)(2) provides the ampacities for flexible cords and flexible cables with not more than three currentcarrying conductors. These tables shall be used in conjunction with applicable end-use product standards to ensure selection of the proper size and type. Where cords and cables are used in ambient temperatures other than 30°C (86°F), the temperature correction factors from Table 310.15(B)(1) that correspond to the temperature rating of the cord or cable shall be applied to the ampacity in Table 400.5(A)(1) and Table 400.5(A)(2). Cords and cables rated 105°C shall use correction factors in the 90°C column of Table 310.15(B)(1) for temperature correction. Where the number of current-carrying conductors exceeds three, the ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced from the threeconductor rating as shown in Table 400.5(A)(3). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note: See Informative Annex  B, Table B.2(11), for adjustment factors for more than three currentcarrying conductors in a raceway or cable with load diversity.\n\nA neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be required to meet the requirements of a current-carrying conductor.\n\nIn a 3-wire circuit consisting of two phase conductors and the neutral conductor of a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system, a common conductor carries approximately the same current as the line-to-neutral currents of the other conductors and shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor.\n\nOn a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye circuit where more than 50 percent of the load consists of nonlinear loads, there are harmonic currents present in the neutral conductor and the neutral conductor shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor.\n\nAn equipment grounding conductor shall not be considered a current-carrying conductor.\n\nWhere a single conductor is used for both equipment grounding and to carry unbalanced current from other conductors, as provided for in 250.140 for electric ranges and electric clothes dryers, it shall not be considered as a current-carrying conductor.\n\n##### (B) Ultimate Insulation Temperature. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way with respect to the kind of circuit, the wiring method used, or the number of conductors such that the limiting temperature of the conductors is exceeded.\n\n\n##### (C) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated in accordance with 310.14(B).\n",

This is enforced by **Section 402.5**, which prohibits exceeding the insulation temperature limits specified in Table 402.3.\n\n**Exception Check:**  \n- **CEC 402.12** adds a critical restriction: *Fixture wires shall not be used as branch-circuit conductors except as permitted elsewhere in this Code.* While this does not override the temperature rating, it limits where SF-2 wire can be applied (e.g., restricted to fixture wiring within luminaires, not general branch circuits).\n\n**NEC 2023 Reference**  \nNo difference from NEC 2023. NEC Table 402.3 and Article 402.12 specify identical maximum operating temperatures and usage restrictions for Type SF-2 silicone insulated fixture wire.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 2 [CEC 2022 Section 300.2] (relevance: 0.69)\n#### 300.2 Limitations\n\n\n\n##### (B) Temperature.

Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

The referenced sections (210.52, 210.50, etc.) address receptacle spacing, installation height, and appliance-specific outlets but **do not override or exempt** the GFCI mandate in 210.8(A)(6).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Comparison and Conclusion**\n\n#### **CEC 2022 (California):**\n- **GFCI Required For**: All 125V–250V receptacles in kitchens serving countertop surfaces (210.8(A)(6)).  \n- **Exceptions**: **None** explicitly apply to countertop receptacles.  \n- **Additional Coverage**: Extends GFCI to receptacles near sinks (within 1.8 m/6 ft) and indoor damp/wet locations.  \n\n#### **NEC 2023:**\n- **GFCI Required For**: Countertop receptacles (210.8(A)(2)).  \n- **Exceptions**:  \n  - Listed appliances (e.g., built-in ovens, dishwashers) may be exempt if installed per 422.5(B).  \n  - Industrial/healthcare exceptions (not typical for residential kitchens).  \n\n---\n\n### **Which Code is More Restrictive?**\n**CEC 2022 is more restrictive** than NEC 2023 for kitchen GFCI requirements because:  \n1. **No Exceptions for Appliances**: CEC requires GFCI for all countertop receptacles, while NEC allows exceptions for listed appliances.  \n2. **Broader Scope**: CEC includes additional locations (e.g., near sinks, damp areas) not fully covered by NEC.  \n3. **Fewer Loopholes**: CEC’s exceptions (e.g., for ceiling fans) do not apply to general countertop use, ensuring stricter personnel protection.  \n\nThis makes California’s requirements stricter for residential kitchens, prioritizing higher safety standards against ground faults.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

It **provides no exceptions** for standard countertop receptacles in residential kitchens.  \n2. It **integrates GFCI with strict spacing rules** (210.52(C)), ensuring coverage for all countertop areas.  \n3. NEC allows broader exceptions (e.g., alarm systems) not applicable to typical residential kitchens.  \n\n**Sources**:  \n✓ **CEC 2022**: Sections 210.8(A)(6), 210.52(C), exceptions reviewed  \n✓ **NEC 2023**: Sections 210.8(B)(2), exceptions for alarm systems and industrial use  \n\nLet me know if you need further details!",

          "answer": "## Panelboard Space Requirements Comparison (CEC 2022 vs NEC 2023) – Final Answer\n\n### **1. California-Specific Requirements (CEC 2022)**\n- **408.2(A):**  \n  *Single-family dwellings* must have **dedicated circuit breaker spaces** for:  \n  - Heat pump water heaters  \n  - Heat pump space heaters  \n  - Electric cooktops  \n  - Electric clothes dryers  \n  **[CEC]** This is a California Energy Code mandate (Section 150.0) not present in NEC.  \n\n- **408.2(B):**  \n  *Multifamily buildings* require similar pre-wiring for dryers, cooktops, and space heaters.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Wire-Bending Space Exceptions (CEC 2022 Section 408.55)**\n#### **CEC Exceptions vs NEC:**\n- **Exception No. 1:**  \n  Panelboards ≤ 225A with ≤ 42 overcurrent devices may use **Table 312.6(A)** instead of 312.6(B).  \n  - *NEC Comparison:* Same exception exists in NEC 2023, but CEC explicitly references California Energy Code.  \n\n- **Exception No. 3:**  \n  Single 90° bends allow **Table 312.6(A)** spacing if wiring diagrams specify the method.  \n  - *NEC Comparison:* NEC allows this but lacks CEC’s explicit wiring diagram requirement.  \n\n- **Exception No. 4:**  \n  If no conductors are terminated in a top/bottom space, **Table 312.6(A)** applies.  \n  - *NEC Comparison:* Identical exception in NEC.  \n\n#### **Key CEC Addition:**  \n- **California Energy Code Integration:**  \n  CEC 408.2(A) directly ties to California Energy Code Sections 150.0/160.9, mandating future-ready panelboard spaces. NEC has no equivalent.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Fault Current Marking (408.6)**\n- **CEC:** Excludes single-family dwellings from field marking requirements.  \n- **NEC:** Requires marking for all except single-family dwellings.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Cross-Referenced Tables**\n- **Table 312.6(A):** Minimum bending space for 90° bends.  \n- **Table 312.6(B):** Minimum bending space for 180° bends.  \n  - *Both codes use these tables, but CEC adds exceptions for single-family panelboards.*  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Differences**\n| **Aspect**                | **CEC 2022**                                                                 | **NEC 2023**                          |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Appliance Pre-Wiring**   | Mandates spaces for future appliances in single-family dwellings [CEC].    | No such requirement.                   |\n| **Wire-Bending Exceptions**| Explicit exceptions for ≤ 225A panelboards and single 90° bends.             | Same exceptions, but no [CEC] tags.    |\n| **Energy Code Integration**| Direct references to California Energy Code Sections 150.0/160.9.          | No state-specific energy code links.     |\n| **Fault Current Marking**  | Excludes single-family dwellings from field marking.                        | Applies to all except single-family.     |\n\n---\n\n## NEC 2023 Reference\n- **NEC 408.2:** Lacks California-specific appliance pre-wiring requirements.  \n- **NEC 408.55:** Wire-bending rules align with CEC but without [CEC] amendments.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

California-Specific Requirements (CEC 2022)**\n- **408.2(A):**  \n  *Single-family dwellings* must have **dedicated circuit breaker spaces** for:  \n  - Heat pump water heaters  \n  - Heat pump space heaters  \n  - Electric cooktops  \n  - Electric clothes dryers  \n  **[CEC]** This is a California Energy Code mandate (Section 150.0) not present in NEC.  \n\n- **408.2(B):**  \n  *Multifamily buildings* require similar pre-wiring for dryers, cooktops, and space heaters.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Wire-Bending Space Exceptions (CEC 2022 Section 408.55)**\n#### **CEC Exceptions vs NEC:**\n- **Exception No. 1:**  \n  Panelboards ≤ 225A with ≤ 42 overcurrent devices may use **Table 312.6(A)** instead of 312.6(B).  \n  - *NEC Comparison:* Same exception exists in NEC 2023, but CEC explicitly references California Energy Code.  \n\n- **Exception No. 3:**  \n  Single 90° bends allow **Table 312.6(A)** spacing if wiring diagrams specify the method.  \n  - *NEC Comparison:* NEC allows this but lacks CEC’s explicit wiring diagram requirement.  \n\n- **Exception No. 4:**  \n  If no conductors are terminated in a top/bottom space, **Table 312.6(A)** applies.  \n  - *NEC Comparison:* Identical exception in NEC.  \n\n#### **Key CEC Addition:**  \n- **California Energy Code Integration:**  \n  CEC 408.2(A) directly ties to California Energy Code Sections 150.0/160.9, mandating future-ready panelboard spaces. NEC has no equivalent.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Fault Current Marking (408.6)**\n- **CEC:** Excludes single-family dwellings from field marking requirements.  \n- **NEC:** Requires marking for all except single-family dwellings.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Cross-Referenced Tables**\n- **Table 312.6(A):** Minimum bending space for 90° bends.  \n- **Table 312.6(B):** Minimum bending space for 180° bends.  \n  - *Both codes use these tables, but CEC adds exceptions for single-family panelboards.*  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Differences**\n| **Aspect**                | **CEC 2022**                                                                 | **NEC 2023**                          |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Appliance Pre-Wiring**   | Mandates spaces for future appliances in single-family dwellings [CEC].    | No such requirement.                   |\n| **Wire-Bending Exceptions**| Explicit exceptions for ≤ 225A panelboards and single 90° bends.             | Same exceptions, but no [CEC] tags.    |\n| **Energy Code Integration**| Direct references to California Energy Code Sections 150.0/160.9.          | No state-specific energy code links.     |\n| **Fault Current Marking**  | Excludes single-family dwellings from field marking.                        | Applies to all except single-family.     |\n\n---\n\n## NEC 2023 Reference\n- **NEC 408.2:** Lacks California-specific appliance pre-wiring requirements.  \n- **NEC 408.55:** Wire-bending rules align with CEC but without [CEC] amendments.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

Exceptions allow smaller spaces (Table 312.6(A)) under specific conditions (e.g., panelboards ≤ 225A with ≤ 42 overcurrent devices).  \n   - **NEC 408.55**: Similar requirements with identical exceptions. No material differences.\n\n3. **Enclosure Requirements**  \n   - **CEC 408.38**: Panelboards must be dead-front (sealed) unless exceptions apply.  \n   - **NEC 408.38**: Same dead-front requirement. No differences.\n\n---\n\n### **National Electrical Code (NEC 2023) Requirements**\n1. **General Panelboard Rating**  \n   - **NEC 408.30**: Panelboards must have a rating ≥ minimum feeder capacity (per Article 220).  \n   - **CEC 408.30**: Identical requirement. No differences.\n\n2. **Grounding**  \n   - **NEC 408.40**: Requires equipment grounding conductors to be bonded to metal frames and terminal bars.  \n   - **CEC 408.40**: Same grounding requirements. No differences.\n\n3. **Marking**  \n   - **NEC 408.58**: Panelboards must be marked with voltage, current rating, and phase information.  \n   - **CEC 408.58**: Identical marking requirements. No differences.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences**\n| **Requirement**                | **CEC 2022**                                                                 | **NEC 2023**                          |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Appliance-Specific Spaces**    | Mandates spaces for heat pump water heaters, cooktops, etc. [CEC 408.2(A)] | **No requirement** for reserved spaces |\n| **Wire-Bending Space Exceptions**| Same as NEC 408.55 with identical exceptions.                                  | Same exceptions apply.                 |\n| **Enclosure/Marking**            | Identical to NEC.                                                            | Identical to CEC.                        |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **CEC 2022** adds **California-specific energy code requirements** for panelboard spaces in single-family dwellings, particularly for future-proofing with energy-efficient appliances.  \n- **NEC 2023** lacks these appliance-specific mandates but aligns with CEC on general panelboard design, wire-bending, and grounding.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (California), NEC 2023 (reference)**",

General scope covers EV charging but lacks specific state-level green building requirements.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Branch Circuit Requirements**\n- **CEC 625.40**: Requires **individual branch circuits** for EV charging outlets with **no other outlets** on the circuit.  \n- **NEC 625.40**: Same requirement—dedicated circuits for EV charging.  \n  - **No difference** from NEC in this provision.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Receptacle Enclosures (Wet Locations)**\n- **CEC 625.56**:  \n  - Enclosures must be **weatherproof** with the plug inserted/removed.  \n  - **Extra-duty** outlet box hoods required if used.  \n  - Alternative weatherproof enclosures must be **listed** but not marked \"extra duty.\"  \n- **NEC 625.56**:  \n  - Requires weatherproof enclosures but **no \"extra-duty\" marking** requirement.  \n  - **Difference**: CEC adds stricter enclosure specifications for durability.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Electrified Truck Parking Spaces**\n- **CEC Article 626**:  \n  - Dedicated article for electrified truck parking spaces (not in NEC).  \n  - Covers wiring systems, load calculations, and installation specifics for commercial truck charging.  \n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  - No equivalent article. Truck charging falls under general EV provisions in Article 625.  \n  - **Difference**: CEC provides **state-specific commercial EV infrastructure rules**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Ground-Fault Protection**\n- **CEC 625.60(D)**:  \n  - Requires **GFCI protection** for all EV receptacles with **readily accessible reset/indication**.  \n- **NEC 625.60(D)**:  \n  - Same GFCI requirement.  \n  - **No difference** in personnel protection.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Power Export Systems**\n- **CEC 625.56(C)**:  \n  - Requires **integral overcurrent protection** for EV power export systems.  \n  - Protection must account for **maximum fault current** at the receptacle.  \n- **NEC 625.56(C)**:  \n  - Similar overcurrent requirements but **no explicit fault-current rating mandate**.  \n  - **Difference**: CEC adds fault-current evaluation for safety.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Differences\n| **Requirement**               | **CEC 2022**                          | **NEC 2023**          |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| CALGreen compliance           | Required for new construction          | Not applicable         |\n| Enclosure durability          | Extra-duty hoods required              | Basic weatherproofing  |\n| Truck parking spaces          | Dedicated Article 626                  | Covered under Article 625 |\n| Fault-current evaluation      | Required for power export systems      | Not explicitly required |\n\n✓ **Sources**: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",

Scope and Applicability**\n- **CEC 625.1**: Explicitly includes compliance with **CALGreen standards** for new construction (Chapter 4/5).  \n  - NEC 2023 has no equivalent green building integration.  \n- **CEC 626**: Dedicated article for **electrified truck parking spaces** (commercial/industrial).  \n  - NEC 2023 lacks specific requirements for truck parking EV infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Branch Circuit Requirements**\n- **CEC 625.40**:  \n  - *Mandate*: Individual branch circuit **exclusively** for EV charging (no other outlets).  \n  - NEC 210.11(K) also requires dedicated circuits but allows shared circuits for **up to two EVs** in multifamily dwellings.  \n- **CEC 625.56**:  \n  - *Weatherproof enclosures* for outdoor EV receptacles (extra-duty hoods required).  \n  - NEC 625.53(A) requires weatherproof enclosures but does not specify \"extra-duty\" hoods.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Receptacle and Overcurrent Protection**\n- **CEC 625.56(D)**:  \n  - *GFCI protection* **must** have **readily accessible reset/indication**.  \n  - NEC 625.52 requires GFCI but does not specify accessibility of reset/indication.  \n- **CEC 625.60(C)**:  \n  - Overcurrent protection for **power export systems** must be **integral to the system**.  \n  - NEC 625.48 allows overcurrent protection in the premises wiring, not necessarily integral.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Load Calculations**\n- **CEC 220.57**:  \n  - EVSE load calculated at **7200VA or nameplate rating** (same as NEC 220.57).  \n- **CEC CALGreen 4.1.4.1**:  \n  - Requires **EV-ready wiring** in new residential construction (no NEC equivalent).  \n- **NEC 220.53**:  \n  - Excludes EVSE from demand factors (CEC follows this but adds CALGreen mandates).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Equipment Standards**\n- **CEC 625.1 Informational Note**:  \n  - References **UL 2594** (EVSE safety) and **UL 2202** (charging systems).  \n  - NEC 100 defines EVSE but does not reference these UL standards explicitly.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Special Provisions for California**\n- **CALGreen Compliance**:  \n  - CEC requires **EV-ready infrastructure** in new buildings (wiring, dedicated circuits).  \n  - NEC has no such mandate.  \n- **Truck Parking Spaces**:  \n  - CEC 626 details electrical systems for **commercial electrified truck parking** (no NEC counterpart).  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences Summary**\n| **Requirement**               | **CEC 2022**                                                                 | **NEC 2023**                              |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Dedicated branch circuits     | Exclusive to EV charging (625.40)                                           | Allows shared circuits in multifamily (210.11(K)) |\n| Weatherproof enclosures       | Requires \"extra-duty\" hoods for outdoor receptacles (625.56)               | General weatherproofing (625.53)        |\n| GFCI accessibility            | Reset/indication must be **readily accessible** (625.56(D))                 | No accessibility requirement              |\n| Overcurrent protection         | Must be **integral to power export systems** (625.60(C))                   | Permits premises-side protection (625.48)  |\n| Green building integration  | CALGreen mandates (625.1, CALGreen 4.1.4.1)                                | No equivalent                           |\n| Truck parking infrastructure  | Dedicated Article 626 for electrified truck parking                          | No specific provisions                  |\n\n---\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (California), NEC 2023 (reference)**",

This exception is **not present in NEC 2023**, which requires arc-fault protection universally for PV DC circuits ≥80V.\n\n- **AFCI for Branch Circuits (210.12):**  \n  While not directly related to PV systems, this exception shows California's broader AFCI requirements for residential branch circuits. No direct impact on PV systems but highlights California's stricter electrical safety approach.\n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Reference**\nThe base NEC 2023 Article 690 remains largely unchanged from prior editions. California's CEC 2022 adds **specific exceptions and cross-references** to other articles (705, 706, 710, 712) that are either absent or less detailed in the national code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Determination**\nCalifornia's CEC 2022 imposes **stricter interconnection requirements** and **additional exceptions** for solar PV systems compared to NEC 2023. Key differences include:\n- Mandatory cross-references to Articles 705, 706, and 712 for PV system interconnections and energy storage.\n- Permitted exceptions for arc-fault protection in specific installations (metallic raceways, underground, detached structures).\n- Explicit treatment of AC modules and stand-alone systems with California-specific references.\n\nThese amendments reflect California's emphasis on **solar integration safety** and **local installation conditions** not fully addressed in the national code.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

This exception is **not present in NEC 2023**, which requires arc-fault protection universally for PV DC circuits ≥80V.\n\n- **AFCI for Branch Circuits (210.12):**  \n  While not directly related to PV systems, this exception shows California's broader AFCI requirements for residential branch circuits. No direct impact on PV systems but highlights California's stricter electrical safety approach.\n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Reference**\nThe base NEC 2023 Article 690 remains largely unchanged from prior editions. California's CEC 2022 adds **specific exceptions and cross-references** to other articles (705, 706, 710, 712) that are either absent or less detailed in the national code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Determination**\nCalifornia's CEC 2022 imposes **stricter interconnection requirements** and **additional exceptions** for solar PV systems compared to NEC 2023. Key differences include:\n- Mandatory cross-references to Articles 705, 706, and 712 for PV system interconnections and energy storage.\n- Permitted exceptions for arc-fault protection in specific installations (metallic raceways, underground, detached structures).\n- Explicit treatment of AC modules and stand-alone systems with California-specific references.\n\nThese amendments reflect California's emphasis on **solar integration safety** and **local installation conditions** not fully addressed in the national code.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

All PV systems ≥80V DC require DC arc-fault protection regardless of installation type.\n\n---\n\n### **Updated Comparison Summary**\n\n#### 1. **Arc-Fault Protection (690.11)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - **Exception for non-building systems** (e.g., ground-mounted arrays in metallic conduit).\n  - Detached structures (e.g., PV racking enclosures) excluded from \"building\" definition.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - **No exception** for non-building installations. All systems ≥80V DC must have DC arc-fault protection.\n- **Impact:** California allows cost savings for ground-mounted systems using metallic raceways, while NEC requires protection regardless of installation.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Hybrid System Compliance (690.59)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Requires compliance with **Article 705 (Energy Systems)** and **Article 712 (Fuel Cell Systems)** for PV systems connected to other sources.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Only references **Article 705** for interconnection. No mention of fuel cell systems (Article 712).\n- **Difference:** CEC mandates additional compliance with fuel cell standards (Article 712), which NEC does not.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Energy Storage Systems (690.71)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Requires compliance with **Article 706 (Energy Storage Systems)**.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - No direct reference to energy storage in Article 690.\n- **Difference:** CEC explicitly integrates energy storage requirements via Article 706.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Stand-Alone Systems (690.10)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - References **Article 710 (Stand-Alone Systems)** for installation.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Includes stand-alone requirements directly in Article 690.\n- **Difference:** CEC separates stand-alone systems into a dedicated article.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **AC Modules (690.6)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Treats AC modules as internal components, exempting them from standard PV source circuit rules.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Similar treatment but lacks CEC's explicit \"internal components\" language.\n- **Difference:** CEC provides clearer exemptions for AC module internal components.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-Reference Compliance**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Cross-references **Articles 705, 706, 710, and 712**, creating a more integrated code framework for hybrid and storage systems.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Lacks explicit cross-references to fuel cell (712) and energy storage (706) standards in Article 690.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Determination**\nCalifornia's CEC 2022 introduces **three key modifications** to NEC 2023 Article 690:\n1. **Exception for non-building PV systems** using metallic raceways (690.11).\n2. **Mandatory compliance with Articles 705, 706, and 712** for hybrid systems.\n3. **Dedicated Article 710** for stand-alone systems.\n\nThese amendments reflect California's emphasis on **system integration**, **safety in non-traditional installations**, and **energy storage compliance**.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

All PV systems ≥80V DC require DC arc-fault protection regardless of installation type.\n\n---\n\n### **Updated Comparison Summary**\n\n#### 1. **Arc-Fault Protection (690.11)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - **Exception for non-building systems** (e.g., ground-mounted arrays in metallic conduit).\n  - Detached structures (e.g., PV racking enclosures) excluded from \"building\" definition.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - **No exception** for non-building installations. All systems ≥80V DC must have DC arc-fault protection.\n- **Impact:** California allows cost savings for ground-mounted systems using metallic raceways, while NEC requires protection regardless of installation.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Hybrid System Compliance (690.59)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Requires compliance with **Article 705 (Energy Systems)** and **Article 712 (Fuel Cell Systems)** for PV systems connected to other sources.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Only references **Article 705** for interconnection. No mention of fuel cell systems (Article 712).\n- **Difference:** CEC mandates additional compliance with fuel cell standards (Article 712), which NEC does not.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Energy Storage Systems (690.71)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Requires compliance with **Article 706 (Energy Storage Systems)**.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - No direct reference to energy storage in Article 690.\n- **Difference:** CEC explicitly integrates energy storage requirements via Article 706.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Stand-Alone Systems (690.10)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - References **Article 710 (Stand-Alone Systems)** for installation.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Includes stand-alone requirements directly in Article 690.\n- **Difference:** CEC separates stand-alone systems into a dedicated article.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **AC Modules (690.6)**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Treats AC modules as internal components, exempting them from standard PV source circuit rules.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Similar treatment but lacks CEC's explicit \"internal components\" language.\n- **Difference:** CEC provides clearer exemptions for AC module internal components.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-Reference Compliance**\n- **CEC 2022:**  \n  - Cross-references **Articles 705, 706, 710, and 712**, creating a more integrated code framework for hybrid and storage systems.\n- **NEC 2023:**  \n  - Lacks explicit cross-references to fuel cell (712) and energy storage (706) standards in Article 690.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Determination**\nCalifornia's CEC 2022 introduces **three key modifications** to NEC 2023 Article 690:\n1. **Exception for non-building PV systems** using metallic raceways (690.11).\n2. **Mandatory compliance with Articles 705, 706, and 712** for hybrid systems.\n3. **Dedicated Article 710** for stand-alone systems.\n\nThese amendments reflect California's emphasis on **system integration**, **safety in non-traditional installations**, and **energy storage compliance**.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",
