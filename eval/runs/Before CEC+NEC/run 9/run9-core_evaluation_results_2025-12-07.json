Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Primary Rule**:  \n   **CEC 408.41** requires each grounded conductor to terminate in an **individual terminal** unless the terminal is explicitly identified for multiple conductors (e.g., parallel conductors). Standard 20A breaker terminals are **not marked** for two conductors.\n\n2. **Exception Check**:  \n   The exception in **408.41** permits multiple conductors on a single terminal **only for parallel conductors** (e.g., multiwire branch circuits with a shared neutral). This scenario does **not involve parallel conductors**, so the exception does **not apply**.\n\n3. **Equipment Labeling**:  \n   Per **CEC 110.3(B)**, equipment must be used in accordance with its labeling. Since the breaker terminal is **not marked** for two conductors, this installation violates the equipment's approved usage.\n\n4. **NEC 2023 Reference**:  \n   NEC 2023 aligns with CEC 2022. **NEC 408.41** and **NEC 110.3(B)** prohibit this practice unless the terminal is listed for multiple conductors.\n\n---\n\n**Corrective Action**:  \n- Use a **breaker with a terminal marked for two conductors** (e.g., \"2-wire\" or \"2-conductor\" labeled terminals).  \n- Alternatively, use a **junction box** to split the two conductors before connecting to separate terminals.  \n\n**Sources**: CEC 2022 Sections 110.3(B), 408.41; NEC 2023 Sections 110.3(B), 408.41.",

      "answer": "## Why CEC Requires AFCI Protection in Bedrooms and Living Areas (CEC 2022)\n\n### **Requirement**\nCEC 2022 **Section 210.12** mandates **Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI)** protection for all 120-volt, single-phase, 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits in:\n- **Dwelling units**: Bedrooms, living rooms, hallways, closets, kitchens, and similar areas.\n- **Dormitory units**: Bedrooms, living rooms, and similar spaces.\n- **Guest rooms/hotel suites**: Guest rooms in hotels/motels.\n\nThis aligns with NEC 210.12 but includes California-specific enforcement through Title 24.\n\n---\n\n### **Electrical Hazard Prevented**\nAFCI protection prevents **electrical fires caused by arc faults**, which occur due to:\n- Damaged or degraded wiring\n- Loose connections\n- Overloaded circuits\n- Improper use of extension cords\n\nStandard circuit breakers do not detect arcs unless they cause overcurrent. AFCIs identify abnormal arcing patterns and interrupt the circuit to mitigate fire risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Exceptions in CEC 2022**\n1. **Fire alarm systems** (Section 210.12, Exception):  \n   - AFCI protection not required for circuits supplying fire alarm systems installed per **760.41(B)** or **760.121(B)**.  \n   - Wiring must use metal raceway, MC cable, or equivalent per **250.118**.\n\n2. **Arc welding equipment** (Exception to 210.12(D)):  \n   - Exempt until January 1, 2025.\n\n3. **Branch circuit modifications** (Section 210.12(D)):  \n   - AFCI not required for extensions ≤ 1.8 m (6 ft) without additional outlets/devices.\n\n4. **Supplemental protection systems**:  \n   - Combination-type AFCIs (UL 1699) or outlet branch-circuit AFCIs (UL 1699A) permitted under specific installation conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-References and Notes**\n- **UL Standards**:  \n  - Combination-type AFCIs: UL 1699  \n  - Outlet branch-circuit AFCIs: UL Subject 1699A  \n- **Fire alarm power requirements**: See **760.41(B)** and **760.121(B)**.\n- **Conduit/enclosure requirements**: Metal raceways or concrete-encased conduits permitted for certain AFCI installations.\n\n---\n\n### **Comparison to NEC 2023**\n- **No substantive differences** in AFCI requirements for bedrooms/living areas between CEC 2022 and NEC 2023.  \n- California enforces NEC mandates but adds **Title 24** requirements for energy efficiency and electrification (e.g., EV readiness), which are separate from AFCI rules.\n\n✓ Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",

Arc faults occur when damaged or worn wiring creates high-resistance connections, generating heat that can ignite surrounding materials. Common causes include:\n- Damaged cords or outlets\n- Loose connections\n- Overloaded circuits\n- Improper use of extension cords\n\nStandard circuit breakers do not detect arcs unless they cause an overcurrent. AFCIs, however, identify abnormal arcing patterns and interrupt the circuit to mitigate fire risk.\n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Reference**\n- **Section 210.12(A)(1)**: Requires listed combination-type AFCIs for branch circuits in dwelling units.\n- **Informational Note**: References UL 1699 standards for AFCI devices, emphasizing their role in fire prevention.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Exceptions**\n- **Fire alarm systems** (760.41(B)/760.121(B)) are exempt if installed per code.\n- **Arc welding equipment** is exempt until 2025 (Exception No. 2).\n\n---\n\n### **Comparison to CEC (California)**\nCalifornia follows NEC requirements for AFCI protection but may have additional mandates (e.g., for EV infrastructure). No significant differences in bedroom/living area AFCI rules between CEC 2022 and NEC 2023.\n\n✓ Sources: NEC 2023 (primary), CEC 2022 (comparison)",

AFCIs identify abnormal arcing patterns and interrupt the circuit to mitigate fire risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Exceptions in CEC 2022**\n1. **Fire alarm systems** (Section 210.12, Exception):  \n   - AFCI protection not required for circuits supplying fire alarm systems installed per **760.41(B)** or **760.121(B)**.  \n   - Wiring must use metal raceway, MC cable, or equivalent per **250.118**.\n\n2. **Arc welding equipment** (Exception to 210.12(D)):  \n   - Exempt until January 1, 2025.\n\n3. **Branch circuit modifications** (Section 210.12(D)):  \n   - AFCI not required for extensions ≤ 1.8 m (6 ft) without additional outlets/devices.\n\n4. **Supplemental protection systems**:  \n   - Combination-type AFCIs (UL 1699) or outlet branch-circuit AFCIs (UL 1699A) permitted under specific installation conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-References and Notes**\n- **UL Standards**:  \n  - Combination-type AFCIs: UL 1699  \n  - Outlet branch-circuit AFCIs: UL Subject 1699A  \n- **Fire alarm power requirements**: See **760.41(B)** and **760.121(B)**.\n- **Conduit/enclosure requirements**: Metal raceways or concrete-encased conduits permitted for certain AFCI installations.\n\n---\n\n### **Comparison to NEC 2023**\n- **No substantive differences** in AFCI requirements for bedrooms/living areas between CEC 2022 and NEC 2023.  \n- California enforces NEC mandates but adds **Title 24** requirements for energy efficiency and electrification (e.g., EV readiness), which are separate from AFCI rules.\n\n✓ Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",

The prescriptive methods contained in Article 250 shall be followed to comply with the performance requirements of this section.\n\n## (A) Grounded Systems.\n\n- (1) Electrical System Grounding. Electrical systems that are grounded shall be connected to earth in a manner that will limit the voltage imposed by lightning, line surges, or unintentional contact with higher-voltage lines and that will stabilize the voltage to earth during normal operation.\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: An important consideration for limiting the imposed voltage is the routing of bonding and grounding electrode conductors so that they are not any longer than necessary to complete the connection without disturbing the permanent parts of the installation and so that unnecessary bends and loops are avoided.\n\n•\n\nFIGURE 250.1 Grounding and Bonding. ∆\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformational Note No.  2: See NFPA  780-2017, Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems , for information on installation of grounding and bonding for lightning protection systems.\n\n- (2) Grounding of Electrical Equipment. Normally noncurrent-carrying conductive materials enclosing electrical conductors or equipment, or forming part of such equipment, shall be connected to earth so as to limit the voltage to ground on these materials.\n\n\n- (3) Bonding of Electrical Equipment. Normally noncurrent-carrying conductive materials enclosing electrical conductors or equipment, or forming part of such equipment, shall be connected together and to the electrical supply source in a manner that establishes an effective ground-fault current path.\n\n\n- (4) Bonding of Electrically Conductive Materials and Other Equipment. Normally non-current-carrying electrically conductive materials that are likely to become energized shall be connected together and to the electrical supply source in a manner that establishes an effective ground-fault current path.\n\n\n- (5) Effective Ground-Fault Current Path. Electrical equipment and wiring and other electrically conductive material likely to become energized shall be installed in a manner that\n\n\n## Table 250.3 Additional Grounding and Bonding Requirements ∆\n\n\ncreates a low-impedance circuit facilitating the operation of the overcurrent device or ground detector for high-impedance grounded systems.
