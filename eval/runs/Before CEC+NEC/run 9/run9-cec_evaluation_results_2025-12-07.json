      "nec_reference": "NEC 625 (general installation only)",
      "status": "PASS",
      "answer": "## California EV Charging Requirements (CEC 2022) – Final Answer  \n\n### **1. Dedicated Branch Circuit**  \n- **Section 625.40**: Each EV outlet must have an **individual branch circuit** with no other outlets.  \n- **Exception 625.46**: Systems must prevent **backfeeding** to the premises wiring if utility power is lost (unless permitted by 625.48).  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Continuous Load Sizing**  \n- **Section 625.42**: EV charging is a **continuous load**.  \n  - Service/feeder must be sized for **125% of the load**.  \n  - Adjustable settings on fixed-in-place equipment are allowed if:  \n    - Changes follow manufacturer instructions.  \n    - Adjusted ratings are permanently marked.  \n    - Access is restricted (tool, lock, or password-protected).  \n\n---\n\n### **3. CALGreen Compliance**  \n- **Section 625.1**: EV infrastructure must comply with **CALGreen Chapter 4/5**, including:  \n  - **Reserved panelboard spaces** for EV circuits (CEC 408.2).  \n  - **Minimum 40-amp circuit** for EV-ready homes.  \n- **NEC 2023**: No equivalent mandate; CALGreen is California-specific.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Weatherproof Enclosures**  \n- **Section 625.56**: Outdoor receptacles require **weatherproof enclosures** (extra-duty rated).  \n- **NEC 2023**: Similar in 625.56 but lacks \"extra-duty\" requirement.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. GFCI Protection**  \n- **Section 625.56(D)**: All EV receptacles require **GFCI protection for personnel**.  \n- **NEC 2023**: Same in 210.8 and 625.56.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Ventilation Requirements**  \n- **Section 625.52**: Indoor charging requires **mechanical ventilation** if equipment is not listed for indoor use.  \n- **NEC 2023**: No specific ventilation rules for EV charging.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Receptacle Ratings**  \n- **Section 625.44**: Receptacles must be rated:  \n  - **125V, 15–20A** for portable equipment.  \n  - **250V, 30–50A** for fastened-in-place equipment.  \n\n---\n\n### **8. Cord Length Limits**  \n- **Section 625.17**:  \n  - Portable EVSE: **12 in. (300 mm)** cord.  \n  - Stationary EVSE: **6 ft (1.8 m)** cord.  \n  - Total usable length: **25 ft (7.5 m)** unless using a listed cable management system.  \n\n---\n\n### **9. Overcurrent Protection**  \n- **Section 625.41**: Overcurrent devices must be **125% of continuous EV load**.  \n\n---\n\n### **10. Location Requirements**  \n- **Section 625.50**: EVSE connectors must be at least **18 in. (450 mm)** above indoor floors or **24 in. (600 mm)** above outdoor grade unless listed otherwise.  \n\n---\n\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \n- **Key Differences**:  \n  1. **CALGreen Mandates**: California requires EV-ready infrastructure (40-amp circuits, reserved panel spaces) not in NEC.  \n  2. **Ventilation**: CEC 625.52 adds mechanical ventilation rules for indoor EV charging.  \n  3. **Extra-Duty Enclosures**: CEC 625.56 requires \"extra-duty\" weatherproof enclosures for outdoor receptacles.  \n\n✓ Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n",

The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 2 [CEC 2022 Section 300.2] (relevance: 0.69)\n#### 300.2 Limitations\n\n\n\n##### (B) Temperature.

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

N\n\n\nWhere correction or adjustment factors are required by 310.15(B) or (C), they shall be permitted to be applied to the ampacity associated with the temperature rating of the conductor.\n\nInformational Note No. 1: The service or feeder ratings addressed by this section are based on the standard ampere ratings for fuses and inverse time circuit breakers from 240.6(A).\n\nInformational Note No. 2: See Example D7 in Annex D.\n\nException 5 [CEC 2022 Section 310.14] (relevance: 0.74)\n#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts\n\n\n##### (A) General.\n\n- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n",

For specific PV system grounding configurations permitted in 690.41(A), one of the following conditions shall apply:\n- (1)  For PV systems that are not solidly grounded, the equipment grounding conductor for the output of the PV system, where connected to associated distribution equipment connected to a grounding electrode system, shall be permitted to be the only connection to ground for the system.\n- (2)  For solidly grounded PV  systems, as permitted in 690.41(A)(5), the grounded conductor shall be connected to a grounding electrode system by means of a grounding electrode conductor sized in accordance with 250.166.\nInformational Note:  Most PV systems are functionally grounded systems rather than solidly grounded systems as defined in this Code . For functionally grounded PV systems with an interactive inverter output, the ac equipment grounding conductor is connected to associated grounded ac distribution equipment. This connection is most often the connection to ground for ground-fault protection and equipment grounding of the PV array.\n- (B)  Grounding Electrodes and Grounding Electrode Conductors. Additional grounding electrodes shall be permitted to be installed in accordance with 250.52 and 250.54. Grounding electrodes shall be permitted to be connected directly to the PV module frame(s)  or  support  structure. A  grounding  electrode conductor shall be sized according to 250.66. A support structure for a ground-mounted PV array shall be permitted to be considered a grounding electrode if it meets the requirements of 250.52. PV arrays mounted to buildings shall be permitted to use the metal structural frame of the building if the requirements of 250.68(C)(2) are met. ∆ ·\n",
