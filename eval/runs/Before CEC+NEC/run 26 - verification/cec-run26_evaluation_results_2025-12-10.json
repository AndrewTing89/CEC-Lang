These are specifically for cables rated **2001 volts and above**, which are not covered in standard NEC tables.\n\n### Key CEC-Only Tables:\n1. **Table 311.60(C)(67) through 311.60(C)(86)**  \n   - **Purpose**: Ampacity tables for **Type MV cables** (2001–35,000 volts nominal).\n   - **NEC Comparison**: NEC tables (e.g., 310.16) only cover up to 2000 volts. CEC extends these for higher voltage applications.\n\n2. **Table 311.60(C)(75) and 311.60(C)(76)**  \n   - **Use Case**: Multiconductor MV cables in cable trays (see 392.80(B)(1)).  \n   - **Adjustments**: Includes derating for covered trays (≤95% of listed ampacity).\n\n3. **Table 311.60(C)(69) through 311.60(C)(72)**  \n   - **Use Case**: Single-conductor MV cables in cable trays (see 392.80(B)(2)).  \n   - **Adjustments**: Accounts for spacing, configuration, and tray coverage.\n\n### Why These Are California-Specific:\n- **NEC Limitation**: The NEC does not include ampacity tables for cables above 2000 volts.  \n- **CEC Expansion**: California mandates these tables to address medium-voltage applications (e.g., industrial, utility, and large commercial systems) under Title 24 and CALGreen requirements.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

      "answer": "## Comparison of Kitchen GFCI Requirements: CEC 2022 vs NEC 2023\n\n### **NEC 2023 Requirements**  \n- **Section 210.8(A)(5)**: Requires GFCI protection for **all 125–250V receptacles in kitchens** supplied by single-phase branch circuits (≤150V to ground).  \n  - Applies to **all kitchen receptacles**, including countertop, wall, and floor outlets.  \n  - **No exceptions** for standard kitchen receptacles (exceptions apply to specialized equipment like HVAC, which expire in 2026).  \n\n### **CEC 2022 Requirements**  \n- **Section 210.8(A)(6)**: Requires GFCI protection **only for receptacles serving countertop surfaces**.  \n  - Does **not explicitly mandate GFCI** for other kitchen receptacles (e.g., wall outlets, pantry, or non-countertop areas).  \n  - Exceptions for ceiling luminaires/fans do not affect standard countertop receptacles.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences**  \n1. **Scope of Coverage**:  \n   - **NEC**: Broad. Covers **all kitchen receptacles** (countertop, wall, floor).  \n   - **CEC**: Narrow. Limited to **countertop receptacles**.  \n\n2. **Exceptions**:  \n   - **NEC**: Few exceptions (e.g., HVAC, snow-melting systems).  \n   - **CEC**: Exceptions for ceiling fixtures do not apply to standard kitchen outlets.  \n\n---\n\n### **Which Code is More Restrictive?**  \n**NEC 2023 is more restrictive** because:  \n- It applies GFCI protection to a **broader range of kitchen receptacles** (all, not just countertops).  \n- CEC 2022 limits GFCI requirements to countertop surfaces, leaving other kitchen outlets (e.g., wall or pantry receptacles) without mandatory protection.  \n\n---\n\n### **Code Citations**  \n- **NEC 2023**: 210.8(A)(5)  \n- **CEC 2022**: 210.8(A)(6)  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 and NEC 2023 comparisons.",

Covers **all kitchen receptacles** (countertop, wall, floor).  \n   - **CEC**: Narrow. Limited to **countertop receptacles**.  \n\n2. **Exceptions**:  \n   - **NEC**: Few exceptions (e.g., HVAC, snow-melting systems).  \n   - **CEC**: Exceptions for ceiling fixtures do not apply to standard kitchen outlets.  \n\n---\n\n### **Which Code is More Restrictive?**  \n**NEC 2023 is more restrictive** because:  \n- It applies GFCI protection to a **broader range of kitchen receptacles** (all, not just countertops).  \n- CEC 2022 limits GFCI requirements to countertop surfaces, leaving other kitchen outlets (e.g., wall or pantry receptacles) without mandatory protection.  \n\n---\n\n### **Code Citations**  \n- **NEC 2023**: 210.8(A)(5)  \n- **CEC 2022**: 210.8(A)(6)  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 and NEC 2023 comparisons.",

      "question": "Compare California's solar PV requirements with NEC 2023 Article 690.",
      "answer": "## California (CEC 2022) vs NEC 2023 Article 690 Solar PV Requirements\n\n### 1. **Energy Storage Integration**\n- **CEC 690.71**: Requires energy storage systems connected to PV systems to comply with **Article 706** and mandates installation in accordance with **Article 690**. Explicitly ties storage systems into PV system requirements.\n- **NEC 2023**: Article 690 references energy storage in general terms but does not integrate storage requirements as directly as CEC. NEC 706 is separate and not explicitly cross-referenced in 690.\n\n### 2. **Grounding and Bonding**\n- **CEC 690.42**: Requires the point of grounding connection for systems with ground-fault protective devices to be made **at the ground-fault protective device**. For solidly grounded systems, grounding must occur at a **single point on the PV output circuit**.\n- **NEC 2023**: Grounding requirements exist in Article 690 but lack the explicit single-point grounding mandate for solidly grounded systems. Ground-fault protection is addressed but without the same emphasis on device integration.\n\n### 3. **AC Modules**\n- **CEC 690.6**: Exempts AC modules from PV source circuit requirements (e.g., 690.8, 690.9). Treats **PV source circuits, conductors, and inverters as internal components** of AC modules.\n- **NEC 2023**: Article 690 includes general provisions for AC modules but does not explicitly exempt them from source circuit requirements as clearly as CEC.\n\n### 4. **Labeling and Documentation**\n- **CEC 690.56**: Mandates **permanent labels** at service equipment locations for buildings with PV systems to indicate rapid shutdown compliance. Requires plaques/directories per **705.10 and 712.10** for systems interconnected with utility services.\n- **NEC 2023**: Labeling requirements exist (e.g., 690.15 for rapid shutdown) but lack the explicit multi-reference plaque requirement for utility-interconnected systems.\n\n### 5. **Self-Regulated Charge Control**\n- **CEC 690.72**: Adds specific criteria for self-regulated PV charge control systems, including **battery capacity limits** (charging current × 1 hour < 3% of battery capacity) and compliance with **706.33**.\n- **NEC 2023**: No equivalent section; charge control requirements are general and less prescriptive.\n\n### 6. **PV-Powered Signs**\n- **CEC 600.34**: Explicitly requires PV-powered signs to comply with **Article 690** and includes installation instructions as part of the code.\n- **NEC 2023**: Addresses PV-powered signs in definitions (100) but lacks specific installation mandates tied to Article 690.\n\n### 7. **Interconnection with Other Sources**\n- **CEC 690.59**: Requires compliance with **Articles 705 and 712** for PV systems connected to other sources, emphasizing integration standards.\n- **NEC 2023**: Article 690 references interconnection but does not explicitly mandate adherence to 705/712 as directly as CEC.\n\n---\n\n### Key California-Specific Mandates\n- **Title 24/CALGreen Compliance**: CEC incorporates additional energy efficiency and electrification mandates (e.g., panelboard spaces for PV systems under **408.2**).\n- **Rapid Shutdown Labels**: CEC 690.56(C) mandates labels at **each service equipment location**, exceeding NEC’s general rapid shutdown requirements.\n- **Battery System Integration**: CEC 690.72 and 706.33 impose stricter charge control and storage system requirements than NEC.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Restrictiveness\n- **CEC is MORE RESTRICTIVE** in:\n  - Grounding/bonding specifics (single-point grounding).\n  - Labeling for rapid shutdown and interconnections.\n  - Battery system charge control limits.\n  - AC module exemptions and internal component treatment.\n- **NEC is MORE PERMISSIVE** in:\n  - General flexibility for interconnection without explicit multi-reference plaques.\n  - Less prescriptive language for charge control and storage systems.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

            "llm_content": "## California (CEC 2022) vs NEC 2023 Article 690 Solar PV Requirements\n\n### 1. **Energy Storage Integration**\n- **CEC 690.71**: Requires energy storage systems connected to PV systems to comply with **Article 706** and mandates installation in accordance with **Article 690**. Explicitly ties storage systems into PV system requirements.\n- **NEC 2023**: Article 690 references energy storage in general terms but does not integrate storage requirements as directly as CEC. NEC 706 is separate and not explicitly cross-referenced in 690.\n\n### 2. **Grounding and Bonding**\n- **CEC 690.42**: Requires the point of grounding connection for systems with ground-fault protective devices to be made **at the ground-fault protective device**. For solidly grounded systems, grounding must occur at a **single point on the PV output circuit**.\n- **NEC 2023**: Grounding requirements exist in Article 690 but lack the explicit single-point grounding mandate for solidly grounded systems. Ground-fault protection is addressed but without the same emphasis on device integration.\n\n### 3. **AC Modules**\n- **CEC 690.6**: Exempts AC modules from PV source circuit requirements (e.g., 690.8, 690.9). Treats **PV source circuits, conductors, and inverters as internal components** of AC modules.\n- **NEC 2023**: Article 690 includes general provisions for AC modules but does not explicitly exempt them from source circuit requirements as clearly as CEC.\n\n### 4. **Labeling and Documentation**\n- **CEC 690.56**: Mandates **permanent labels** at service equipment locations for buildings with PV systems to indicate rapid shutdown compliance. Requires plaques/directories per **705.10 and 712.10** for systems interconnected with utility services.\n- **NEC 2023**: Labeling requirements exist (e.g., 690.15 for rapid shutdown) but lack the explicit multi-reference plaque requirement for utility-interconnected systems.\n\n### 5. **Self-Regulated Charge Control**\n- **CEC 690.72**: Adds specific criteria for self-regulated PV charge control systems, including **battery capacity limits** (charging current × 1 hour < 3% of battery capacity) and compliance with **706.33**.\n- **NEC 2023**: No equivalent section; charge control requirements are general and less prescriptive.\n\n### 6. **PV-Powered Signs**\n- **CEC 600.34**: Explicitly requires PV-powered signs to comply with **Article 690** and includes installation instructions as part of the code.\n- **NEC 2023**: Addresses PV-powered signs in definitions (100) but lacks specific installation mandates tied to Article 690.\n\n### 7. **Interconnection with Other Sources**\n- **CEC 690.59**: Requires compliance with **Articles 705 and 712** for PV systems connected to other sources, emphasizing integration standards.\n- **NEC 2023**: Article 690 references interconnection but does not explicitly mandate adherence to 705/712 as directly as CEC.\n\n---\n\n### Key California-Specific Mandates\n- **Title 24/CALGreen Compliance**: CEC incorporates additional energy efficiency and electrification mandates (e.g., panelboard spaces for PV systems under **408.2**).\n- **Rapid Shutdown Labels**: CEC 690.56(C) mandates labels at **each service equipment location**, exceeding NEC’s general rapid shutdown requirements.\n- **Battery System Integration**: CEC 690.72 and 706.33 impose stricter charge control and storage system requirements than NEC.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Restrictiveness\n- **CEC is MORE RESTRICTIVE** in:\n  - Grounding/bonding specifics (single-point grounding).\n  - Labeling for rapid shutdown and interconnections.\n  - Battery system charge control limits.\n  - AC module exemptions and internal component treatment.\n- **NEC is MORE PERMISSIVE** in:\n  - General flexibility for interconnection without explicit multi-reference plaques.\n  - Less prescriptive language for charge control and storage systems.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",
