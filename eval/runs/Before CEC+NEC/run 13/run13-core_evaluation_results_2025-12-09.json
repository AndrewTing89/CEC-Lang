A terminal is **not permitted to have more than one conductor** unless:  \n   - The terminal is **listed and marked** for multiple conductors (Exception 1 to 110.14(C)(1)).  \n\n2. **Breaker Terminal Rating**  \n   The breaker in question is **not marked** for two conductors, violating the requirement that multiple conductors require a terminal specifically listed for this use.  \n\n3. **Overcurrent Protection Compliance**  \n   While 12 AWG copper conductors are permitted on a 20A breaker (per **CEC 240.4(D)(3)**), this does not override the termination rule in 110.14(C).  \n\n### Exceptions Checked:\n- **408.41**: Applies to grounded conductor terminations in panelboards. Not applicable here (ungrounded conductors on a breaker).  \n- **355.60, 300.15, 215.2, 230.90**: None address multiple conductors on a breaker terminal.  \n\n### Corrective Action:\n- Replace the breaker with one **listed for two conductors** (e.g., marked \"2 Wires\") or  \n- Use a **single conductor** per terminal as required.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022",

      "answer": "## California Electrical Code (CEC 2022) Requirement for AFCI Protection in Bedrooms and Living Areas\n\n### **Why AFCI is Required**  \nUnder **CEC 210.12**, arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) protection is mandated for **15A and 20A branch circuits** in dwelling units supplying outlets in:  \n- Bedrooms  \n- Living rooms  \n- Hallways  \n- Closets  \n- Laundry areas  \n- Similar spaces  \n\nThis requirement aligns with the **NEC** but is enforced in California per the CEC. The primary purpose is to **prevent electrical fires caused by arc faults**, which can occur due to damaged wiring, loose connections, or faulty devices.  \n\n---\n\n### **Electrical Hazard Prevented**  \nAFCI protection targets **dangerous arcing faults** that standard circuit breakers cannot detect. Arcs can:  \n- Generate extreme heat (up to 10,000°F), igniting nearby combustibles (e.g., bedding, curtains, furniture).  \n- Occur in hidden locations (e.g., wall cavities, electrical boxes).  \n\n---\n\n### **Key CEC Exceptions**  \n1. **Fire alarm systems**: AFCI is not required for circuits supplying fire alarm systems installed per **760.41(B)** or **760.121(B)**, provided wiring is in metal raceways or listed cables (CEC 210.12 Exception).  \n2. **Short wiring extensions**: No AFCI required for branch circuit extensions ≤6 ft (1.8 m) without additional outlets (CEC 210.12(D) Exception).  \n3. **Replacement receptacles**: Specific rules apply for replacing AFCI-protected outlets (CEC 406.4(D)(4)).  \n\n---\n\n### **Protection Methods**  \nPer **CEC 210.12(A)**, AFCI protection can be achieved via:  \n- **Combination-type AFCI** (most common).  \n- **Branch/feeder-type AFCI** + outlet AFCI at the first outlet.  \n- **System combination-type AFCI** (breaker + outlet device).  \n\n---\n\n### **California-Specific Notes**  \n- CEC 2022 adopts NEC 2023 requirements without additional amendments for AFCI in dwelling units.  \n- Exceptions and installation rules mirror NEC, with no unique California mandates for this section.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, Sections 210.12, 406.4",

The primary purpose is to **prevent electrical fires caused by arc faults**, which can occur due to damaged wiring, loose connections, or faulty devices.  \n\n---\n\n### **Electrical Hazard Prevented**  \nAFCI protection targets **dangerous arcing faults** that standard circuit breakers cannot detect. Arcs can:  \n- Generate extreme heat (up to 10,000°F), igniting nearby combustibles (e.g., bedding, curtains, furniture).  \n- Occur in hidden locations (e.g., wall cavities, electrical boxes).  \n\n---\n\n### **Key CEC Exceptions**  \n1. **Fire alarm systems**: AFCI is not required for circuits supplying fire alarm systems installed per **760.41(B)** or **760.121(B)**, provided wiring is in metal raceways or listed cables (CEC 210.12 Exception).  \n2. **Short wiring extensions**: No AFCI required for branch circuit extensions ≤6 ft (1.8 m) without additional outlets (CEC 210.12(D) Exception).  \n3. **Replacement receptacles**: Specific rules apply for replacing AFCI-protected outlets (CEC 406.4(D)(4)).  \n\n---\n\n### **Protection Methods**  \nPer **CEC 210.12(A)**, AFCI protection can be achieved via:  \n- **Combination-type AFCI** (most common).  \n- **Branch/feeder-type AFCI** + outlet AFCI at the first outlet.  \n- **System combination-type AFCI** (breaker + outlet device).  \n\n---\n\n### **California-Specific Notes**  \n- CEC 2022 adopts NEC 2023 requirements without additional amendments for AFCI in dwelling units.  \n- Exceptions and installation rules mirror NEC, with no unique California mandates for this section.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, Sections 210.12, 406.4",

      "answer": "## Torque Specifications for Conductor Termination (CEC 2022)  \n\nTorque specifications ensure **secure, low-resistance connections** to prevent overheating, arcing, and equipment failure. The primary requirement is found in **CEC 110.14(D)**, with no applicable exceptions modifying this rule for general conductor termination scenarios.  \n\n### Key Requirements:  \n1. **Torque Values** (CEC 110.14(D)):  \n   - Follow **manufacturer-specified torque values** on equipment or installation instructions.  \n   - Use **approved methods** (torque tools, shear bolts, breakaway devices) to achieve the specified torque.  \n   - *Informational Note*: Contact the manufacturer if torque values are not indicated.  \n\n2. **Control Circuit Devices** (CEC 430.9(C)):  \n   - Screw-type terminals with 14 AWG or smaller copper conductors must be torqued to a **minimum of 0.8 N·m (7 lb-in.)** unless marked otherwise.  \n\n3. **Temperature Coordination** (CEC 110.14(C)):  \n   - Conductor ampacity must not exceed the lowest temperature rating of any connected termination (e.g., 60°C or 75°C limitations).  \n\n### Exceptions Review:  \n- No exceptions from **cec_exception_search** directly modify 110.14(D) for general conductor termination.  \n- Sections like **300.15**, **368.17**, **250.148**, and **215.2** address unrelated topics (boxes, overcurrent protection, grounding, feeders) and do not relax torque requirements.  \n\n### Why Compliance Matters:  \n- **Over-torquing** risks damaging terminals or insulation.  \n- **Under-torquing** creates loose connections → heat → potential fire hazards.  \n- Ensures compliance with **UL 486A-486B** and **NFPA 70B** maintenance standards.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Sections 110.14(D), 430.9(C)",

The primary requirement is found in **CEC 110.14(D)**, with no applicable exceptions modifying this rule for general conductor termination scenarios.  \n\n### Key Requirements:  \n1. **Torque Values** (CEC 110.14(D)):  \n   - Follow **manufacturer-specified torque values** on equipment or installation instructions.  \n   - Use **approved methods** (torque tools, shear bolts, breakaway devices) to achieve the specified torque.  \n   - *Informational Note*: Contact the manufacturer if torque values are not indicated.  \n\n2. **Control Circuit Devices** (CEC 430.9(C)):  \n   - Screw-type terminals with 14 AWG or smaller copper conductors must be torqued to a **minimum of 0.8 N·m (7 lb-in.)** unless marked otherwise.  \n\n3. **Temperature Coordination** (CEC 110.14(C)):  \n   - Conductor ampacity must not exceed the lowest temperature rating of any connected termination (e.g., 60°C or 75°C limitations).  \n\n### Exceptions Review:  \n- No exceptions from **cec_exception_search** directly modify 110.14(D) for general conductor termination.  \n- Sections like **300.15**, **368.17**, **250.148**, and **215.2** address unrelated topics (boxes, overcurrent protection, grounding, feeders) and do not relax torque requirements.  \n\n### Why Compliance Matters:  \n- **Over-torquing** risks damaging terminals or insulation.  \n- **Under-torquing** creates loose connections → heat → potential fire hazards.  \n- Ensures compliance with **UL 486A-486B** and **NFPA 70B** maintenance standards.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Sections 110.14(D), 430.9(C)",

      "question": "A 120V single-phase branch circuit supplies a continuous load of 22 amperes. The circuit uses 12 AWG copper conductors with a resistance of 1.29 ohms per 1,000 feet. The one-way distance from the panel to the load is 50 feet. Calculate the voltage drop in volts and as a percentage. Does this meet NEC recommendations (3% maximum for branch circuits)?",
      "expected_answer": "Voltage drop formula: VD = (2 × L × R × I) / 1000. Where: L = 50 feet (one-way distance), R = 1.29 ohms/1000ft for 12 AWG copper (Chapter 9 Table 8), I = 22 amperes, multiply by 2 for round trip. Calculation: VD = (2 × 50 × 1.29 × 22) / 1000 = 2,838 / 1000 = 2.84 volts. Percentage: (2.84V / 120V) × 100 = 2.37%.
