      "answer": "## California EV Charging Requirements (CEC 2022) vs NEC 2023\n\n### **California (CEC 2022) Requirements**\n1. **CALGreen Mandates**  \n   - **EV-Ready Infrastructure**: New residential construction must include:  \n     - Dedicated 40-amp minimum circuits for EV charging.  \n     - Conduit to parking spaces for future EV installations.  \n     - Panelboard capacity to accommodate EV loads (CEC 408.2).  \n\n2. **Branch Circuit Requirements**  \n   - **Individual Circuits**: Each EV outlet must be supplied by an individual branch circuit with no other outlets (625.40).  \n   - **GFCI Protection**: All EV charging receptacles require ground-fault circuit-interrupter (GFCI) protection (625.54).  \n\n3. **Ventilation**  \n   - Indoor EV charging requires mechanical ventilation if equipment is listed to need it (625.52). Ventilation must be interlocked with the charging circuit.  \n\n4. **Cable Lengths**  \n   - Power-supply cords for portable EVSE are limited to 15 ft (4.6 m) unless using a listed cable management system (625.17).  \n\n5. **Personnel Protection**  \n   - Listed personnel protection systems are required for equipment over 60 VDC (625.22).  \n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Comparison**  \n1. **Branch Circuits**  \n   - NEC 625.12 allows shared circuits for EVSE with other loads if the EVSE is listed for such use, whereas CEC mandates individual circuits.  \n\n2. **GFCI Protection**  \n   - NEC 210.8(A)(7) requires GFCI for EV receptacles but does not explicitly mandate it for all EV charging circuits as CEC does.  \n\n3. **Cable Lengths**  \n   - NEC 625.44 limits power-supply cords to 15 ft (4.6 m) for portable EVSE but does not address cable management systems.  \n\n4. **Ventilation**  \n   - NEC does not include specific ventilation requirements for EV charging.  \n\n5. **Load Calculations**  \n   - NEC 220.57 calculates EVSE load at 7,200 VA or nameplate rating, while CEC integrates CALGreen mandates for infrastructure.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences**  \n- **CALGreen Mandates**: California’s CALGreen code adds EV-ready infrastructure requirements (conduit, panel capacity) not present in NEC.  \n- **Ventilation**: CEC 625.52 imposes mechanical ventilation and interlock requirements absent in NEC.  \n- **Cable Management**: CEC explicitly permits longer cords with listed cable management systems (625.17), while NEC does not address this.  \n\n**Conclusion**: California’s CEC is **more restrictive** than NEC 2023 for residential EV charging due to CALGreen mandates, ventilation rules, and specific cable/ventilation interlock requirements.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

These tables provide ampacities for Type MV cables (2001–35,000V) in various configurations and temperature ratings (90°C and 105°C). Key features:\n\n1. **Unique to CEC**:  \n   - Tables 311.60(C)(67)–(86) are **not present in NEC 2023**.  \n   - NEC handles medium voltage (Article 311) but references general ampacity calculations rather than detailed tables for specific MV configurations.\n\n2. **California-Specific Details**:  \n   - Ampacities for **triplied/single-conductor copper cables** in isolated conduit, cable trays, and other installations.  \n   - Separate values for voltage ranges:  \n     - **2001–5000V** (MV-90/MV-105)  \n     - **5001–35,000V** (MV-90/MV-105)  \n   - Temperature ratings up to **105°C** (higher than standard NEC 90°C for MV).\n\n3. **NEC Comparison**:  \n   - NEC 2023 (Article 311) provides general MV guidelines but **no equivalent tables** for California’s specific configurations.  \n   - NEC relies on engineering calculations or references to IEEE/ANSI standards for MV ampacities, while CEC codifies them directly.\n\n---\n\n**Example CEC Table 311.60(C)(67) Excerpt**  \n| Conductor Size | 2001–5000V @ 90°C | 2001–5000V @ 105°C | 5001–35,000V @ 90°C | 5001–35,000V @ 105°C |  \n|----------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|  \n| 4/0 AWG        | 230 A            | 250 A             | 220 A              | 245 A               |  \n| 250 kcmil      | 255 A            | 280 A             | 245 A              | 270 A               |  \n\n---\n\n**Source**: CEC 2022 Section 311.60(C)  \n**NEC 2023 Comparison**: No direct equivalent tables; NEC Article 311 provides general MV requirements without California-specific ampacity tables.  \n\n✓ **Conclusion**: California’s CEC includes **detailed MV cable ampacity tables** (311.60(C)) not found in NEC, reflecting state-specific regulations for medium voltage installations.",

This is a California-specific mandate not explicitly emphasized in NEC.\n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Comparison**\nNEC Table 110.28 includes **similar enclosure types** (3, 3S, 3X, 4, etc.) for outdoor use but:\n- **No explicit \"ice-covered operability\" requirement** in standard NEC text.\n- Raintight enclosures (Types 3, 3S, 3X) are specified, but California’s CEC adds the [*] footnote for ice conditions.\n- Corrosion resistance (Type 3X/4X) is optional in NEC unless specified by local amendments.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **CEC is more restrictive** for ice-prone areas due to the [*] footnote requiring operable mechanisms when iced.\n- Use **Type 3S, 3SX, 4, or 4X** enclosures in California for full compliance with rain, sleet, and ice conditions.\n- NEC allows similar types but lacks California’s ice-specific mandate.\n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Table 110.28 and NEC 2023 comparison.",

While NEC 2023 does not explicitly reference \"Type SF-2,\" it aligns with CEC by allowing silicone insulation at the same temperature rating.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences**  \n1. **Explicit Listing:**  \n   - CEC 2022 **explicitly names** \"Type SF-2\" in Table 402.3 with a 200°C rating.  \n   - NEC 2023 references silicone rubber generically in **310.104(B)** without specific type designations like \"SF-2.\"  \n\n2. **Application Scope:**  \n   - Both codes permit 200°C operation for silicone-insulated wires, but NEC uses broader language for insulation types.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe maximum operating temperature for Type SF-2 silicone insulated fixture wire is **200°C (392°F)** in both CEC 2022 and NEC 2023.

While NEC 2023 does not explicitly reference \"Type SF-2,\" it aligns with CEC by allowing silicone insulation at the same temperature rating.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences**  \n1. **Explicit Listing:**  \n   - CEC 2022 **explicitly names** \"Type SF-2\" in Table 402.3 with a 200°C rating.  \n   - NEC 2023 references silicone rubber generically in **310.104(B)** without specific type designations like \"SF-2.\"  \n\n2. **Application Scope:**  \n   - Both codes permit 200°C operation for silicone-insulated wires, but NEC uses broader language for insulation types.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe maximum operating temperature for Type SF-2 silicone insulated fixture wire is **200°C (392°F)** in both CEC 2022 and NEC 2023. California explicitly lists this type in its tables, while NEC references silicone insulation generically but with equivalent temperature ratings.  \n\n✓ **Sources:** CEC 2022 Table 402.3, NEC 2023 310.104(B)",
