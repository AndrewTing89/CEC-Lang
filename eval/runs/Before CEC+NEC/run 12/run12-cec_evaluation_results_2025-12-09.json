Only short-circuit/ground-fault protection is required.  \n   - **Source**: CEC 2022 Section 430.72(B)\n\n2. **Exception No. 2 (430.72(B))**  \n   - **Transformer Primary Protection**: For single-phase transformers with two-wire secondaries, primary-side overcurrent protection is permitted if it does not exceed:  \n     *Primary protection rating* ≤ (*Table 430.72(B) secondary rating*) × (*Secondary-to-primary voltage ratio*)  \n   - **Source**: CEC 2022 Section 430.72(B)\n\n### **Related Code Sections**\n1. **Combined Overcurrent Protection (430.55)**  \n   - Allows combining short-circuit/ground-fault protection with overload protection in a single device, provided it meets 430.32 requirements.  \n   - **Example**: A circuit breaker serving both functions.\n\n2. **Motor-Circuit Coordination (430.225)**  \n   - Requires coordinated protection to interrupt overload and fault currents.  \n   - **Key Provisions**:  \n     - Overload protection must disconnect all ungrounded conductors.  \n     - Fault-current protection must use circuit breakers or fuses with suitable ratings.  \n\n3. **Overload Protection (430.124)**  \n   - Overload protection is separate from overcurrent protection.  \n   - **Note**: Table 430.72(B) addresses **overcurrent** (short-circuit/ground-fault) protection, not overload protection.\n\n### **Application Notes**\n- **Column Selection**: Use Column A for direct protection, Column B for conductors protected by branch-circuit devices (within enclosures), and Column C for conductors extending beyond enclosures.  \n- **Transformer Calculations**: For transformer-fed circuits, apply the voltage ratio multiplier from Exception No. 2.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Table 430.72(B) and Related Sections",

In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

      "answer": "## Final Comparison of Kitchen GFCI Requirements\n\n### **CEC 2022 Key Exceptions**  \n1. **Ceiling Fixtures**: Listed locking support receptacles for ceiling luminaires/fans are exempt if not general-purpose (210.8(A)(6) Exception).  \n2. **Industrial/Healthcare**: Receptacles in industrial labs or healthcare facilities may bypass GFCI if power interruption creates hazards.  \n3. **Snow-Melting/Deicing**: Dedicated circuits for these systems are exempt (426.28/427.22).  \n\n### **NEC 2023 Key Exceptions**  \n1. **Ceiling Fixtures**: Similar exemption for listed weight-supporting systems (210.8(A) Exception No. 3).  \n2. **HVAC Equipment**: Temporary exemption for listed HVAC equipment (expires 2026).  \n3. **Fire Alarm Systems**: Receptacles for fire alarms may omit GFCI (Exception No. 2).  \n\n---\n\n### **Restrictiveness Analysis**  \n- **Scope**:  \n  - **CEC**: Limited to **countertop receptacles**.  \n  - **NEC**: Covers **all kitchen receptacles**, including laundry, sinks (within 6 ft), and general use.  \n- **Exceptions**:  \n  - **CEC** allows more exceptions (e.g., industrial labs, ceiling fixtures).  \n  - **NEC** has narrower exceptions and broader mandatory coverage.  \n\n**Conclusion**: **NEC 2023 is more restrictive** due to its expanded scope and fewer exceptions.  \n\n**Source**: CEC 2022 210.8(A)(6) Exceptions; NEC 2023 210.8(A)(5), 210.8(A)(7).",
