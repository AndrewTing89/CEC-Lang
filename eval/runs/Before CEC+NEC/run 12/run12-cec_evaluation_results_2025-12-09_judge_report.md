## Methodology

The LLM-as-Judge approach evaluates each agent response against:
1. **Expected Answer** - Ground truth from the question bank
2. **Technical Accuracy** - Correctness of code values, calculations
3. **Completeness** - Coverage of all question aspects
4. **Code References** - Proper NEC/CEC section citations
5. **Reasoning Quality** - Clarity and logic of explanation

A **PASS** verdict requires an overall score >= 6/10.
