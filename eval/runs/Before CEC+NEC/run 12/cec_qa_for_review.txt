AGENT: ## Adjusted Ampacity Calculation (CEC 2022)

1. **Base Ampacity**:  
   8 AWG THWN copper at 75°C = **50A** (Table 310.16)

2. **Temperature Correction (40°C ambient)**:  
   50A × 0.88 (Table 310.15(B)(1)(1)) = **44A**

3. **Bundling Adjustment (7 conductors)**:  
   44A × 0.70 (Table 310.15(C)(1)) = **30.8A**

**Final Adjusted Ampacity**: **30.8 amperes**

**Exception Review**:  
- **Section 440.6** (refrigerant motor-compressors) does not apply here.  
- **Section 310.15** confirms temperature correction and bundling adjustments are permissible **if the corrected ampacity does not exceed the termination temperature rating** (75°C for THWN conductors). Since 30.8A ≤ 50A (original 75°C rating), the calculation is valid.

Q: Calculate the general lighting load for a 5,000 square foot office building in California.
EXPECTED: Per CEC Table 220.12, office buildings require 1.3 VA per square foot (updated from 3.5 VA in NEC 2017 and earlier). General lighting load = 5,000 sq ft x 1.3 VA/sq ft = 6,500 VA (6.5 kVA). Note: The 125% continuous load multiplier is already included in this table value.
AGENT: ## General Lighting Load for Office Building (CEC 2022)  

The general lighting load for a 5,000 sq ft office building in California is calculated as follows:  

1. **Unit Load**: 1.3 VA/ft² (CEC Table 220.12 for "Office")  
2. **Calculation**:  
   $ 5,000 \, \text{ft}^2 \times 1.3 \, \text{VA/ft}^2 = 6,500 \, \text{VA} $  

**Exceptions Checked**:  
- **Section 220.12(B)** allows alternative energy code values *if* a power monitoring system is installed and specific conditions are met. Since the question provides no such context, the standard value applies.  
- Other exceptions (225.32, 215.10) relate to disconnecting means and ground-fault protection, which are unrelated to lighting load calculations.  

**Final Answer**:  
**6,500 volt-amperes** (6.5 kVA)
