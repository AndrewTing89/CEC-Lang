Panelboard Space Requirements (CEC 2022 Section 408.55)**  \n**Wire-Bending Space Dimensions**  \n- **Top/Bottom**: Sized per **Table 312.6(B)** for the largest conductor, **unless exceptions apply**.  \n- **Side**: Sized per **Table 312.6(A)** for the largest conductor.  \n- **Back**: Must comply with **Table 312.6(A)** for raceway/cable entries opposite removable covers.  \n\n**Exceptions** (from `cec_exception_search`):  \n1. **Exception 1**: For panelboards rated **≤225A** with **≤42 overcurrent devices**, top/bottom space can use **Table 312.6(A)**.  \n2. **Exception 3**: If wiring uses **only single 90° bends** (per manufacturer’s wiring diagram), top/bottom space can use **Table 312.6(A)**.  \n3. **Exception 4**: If **no conductors terminate** in a top/bottom space, that space can use **Table 312.6(A)**.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Reserved Circuit Breaker Spaces for Appliances (CEC 2022 Section 408.2)**  \n**Mandatory Reserved Spaces**  \nCalifornia requires **panelboards in single-family dwellings** to include **dedicated circuit breaker spaces** for:  \n- Heat pump water heaters  \n- Heat pump space heaters  \n- Electric cooktops  \n- Electric clothes dryers  \n\n**Exceptions** (from `cec_exception_search`):  \n- No exceptions override this requirement. The reserved spaces are **mandatory** under California Energy Code (Sections 150.0(n), (t), (u), (v)).  \n\n---\n\n### **3. NEC 2023 Comparison**  \n- **Standard NEC**: No mandatory reserved spaces for these appliances unless specified by local amendments.  \n- **California CEC**: Adds **future-ready requirements** to support energy efficiency goals (e.g., Title 24 Energy Code).  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Compliance Notes**  \n- **Wire-Bending Space**: Use exceptions for smaller panelboards (≤225A, ≤42 devices) or specific wiring methods.  \n- **Reserved Spaces**: No exceptions apply—California mandates these spaces for energy-efficient appliances.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

Exceptions only apply to receptacle requirements in specific scenarios, not the panelboard circuit provisions.\n\n---\n## NEC 2023 Reference\nThe base NEC 2023 **does not require** panelboard readiness for future dryers. California's requirements (§408.2 and §422.3) are **amendments specific to CEC** to ensure infrastructure is pre-wired for common appliances in new residential construction.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

Protection devices cannot exceed the common power bus rating.  \n\n---\n\n### **Critical Exceptions**  \n- **Exception No. 1 (430.72):** Control circuits posing a hazard if interrupted (e.g., fire pumps) require only short-circuit/ground-fault protection.  \n- **Exception No. 2 (430.72):** Transformer-supplied control circuits can use primary-side protection if VA rating ≤ 50 VA or primary current <2A.  \n\n---\n\n### **Application Notes**  \n- **Aluminum Conductors:** Not permitted for 18–14 AWG due to termination limitations (110.14(C)).  \n- **Derating for Larger Conductors:**  \n  - Column B: 400% of 310.19 (60°C) values.  \n  - Column C: 300% of 310.16 (60°C) values.  \n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Reference**  \nNo differences from NEC 2023 Article 430.72(B).

These address:\n- **Burial depth derating** (6% per 300 mm).\n- **Cable tray fill and spacing** (e.g., 90% width for large conductors).\n- **Nonshielded cable exceptions** for industrial and airfield applications.\n\n**NEC 2023** provides general medium voltage ampacity tables but lacks California’s specific adjustments for burial depth, cable tray fill, and nonshielded cable use.

For dwelling services, continuous loads, or non-standard installations, additional adjustments/requirements apply.\n\n---\n## NEC 2023 Reference\nNEC 2023 specifies the **same 230A ampacity** for 4/0 AWG copper at 75°C in Table 310.16.

For dwelling services, continuous loads, or non-standard installations, additional adjustments/requirements apply.\n\n---\n## NEC 2023 Reference\nNEC 2023 specifies the **same 230A ampacity** for 4/0 AWG copper at 75°C in Table 310.16.

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

Neutral conductors shall be considered current carrying in accordance with any of the following: ∆\n\n- (1) A neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be required to be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (2) In a 3-wire circuit consisting of two phase conductors and the neutral conductor of a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system, a common conductor carries approximately the same current as the line-to-neutral load currents of the other conductors and shall be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (3) On a 4-wire, 3-phase wye circuit where the major portion of the load consists of nonlinear loads, harmonic currents are present in the neutral conductor; the neutral conductor shall therefore be considered a current-carrying conductor.\n\n##### (F) Grounding or Bonding Conductor. A grounding or bonding conductor shall not be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1). ∆\n\nException 4 [CEC 2022 Section 310.14] (relevance: 0.74)\n#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts\n\n\n##### (A) General.\n\n- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity.

In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nException 5 [CEC 2022 Section 310.12] (relevance: 0.74)\n##### (A) Dry Locations.

      "answer": "## Maximum Overcurrent Protection for 16 AWG Copper Motor Control Circuit Conductors (CEC 2022)\n\n**California Requirement (CEC 2022):**  \nFor motor control circuits using **16 AWG copper conductors** that extend beyond the enclosure, the overcurrent protection is governed by **CEC 2022 Section 430.72(B)** and **CEC 2022 Table 240.4(D)**:\n\n1. **Motor Control Circuit Exception (Section 430.72(B)):**  \n   Conductors in motor control circuits are permitted to be protected by the motor's **overload protective device**. If the 16 AWG conductors are connected **on the load side of a motor overload device**, **no separate overcurrent protection is required** for the conductors. This aligns with the exception in Section 460.8(B) for capacitors connected to motor overload devices.\n\n2. **General Overcurrent Protection (Section 650.8):**  \n   If the conductors are not protected by the motor's overload device, their overcurrent protection must not exceed their ampacity. While 16 AWG is not explicitly listed in Table 240.4(D), **Section 650.8** specifies that 20–28 AWG conductors require protection up to **6 amperes**. By extension, 16 AWG conductors in control circuits should also be protected at **6 amperes** to comply with California's amendments.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference to Motor Control Centers (Section 430.94):**  \n   Motor control centers must have overcurrent protection not exceeding the rating of the common power bus. This reinforces that motor control circuits rely on the main overcurrent device for protection.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n- If the 16 AWG conductors are on the **load side of a motor overload device**, **no separate overcurrent protection is required** (per CEC 430.72(B)).  \n- If not protected by the motor's overload device, the maximum overcurrent protection is **6 amperes** (based on CEC 650.8 for small conductors).\n\n---\n\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \nNEC 2023 aligns with this requirement, specifying that motor control circuit conductors are protected by the motor's overload device (NEC 430.72(B)). For standalone 16 AWG conductors, NEC 240.4(D) does not list 16 AWG, but NEC 650.8 similarly limits 20–28 AWG to 6A.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

Exceptions like those for \"listed combination devices\" (e.g., integrated appliances) **do not apply** to countertop receptacles in kitchens.  \n\n2. **Limited Exceptions in Related Sections**:  \n   - **210.8(A)(5)**: Allows exceptions for fire alarm systems in basements, but this does not apply to kitchens.  \n   - **210.52(C)(1) Exception**: Exempts receptacles directly behind ranges or sinks, but **only for wall-line spacing**, not GFCI requirements.  \n\n3. **Strict Receptacle-Level GFCI**:  \n   CEC mandates **individual receptacles** must have GFCI protection (no circuit-level exceptions for kitchens).  \n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Exceptions**\n1. **Permits Listed Combination Devices**:  \n   NEC 210.8(A)(6) allows exceptions for **listed combination devices** (e.g., countertop receptacles integrated into appliances like microwaves).  \n\n2. **Circuit-Level GFCI Protection**:  \n   NEC permits GFCI protection at the **circuit level** (e.g., a GFCI breaker) instead of individual receptacles.  \n\n3. **Flexibility in Spacing**:  \n   NEC uses a **1.7 m² (18 ft²)** rule for countertop receptacles, which allows fewer GFCI-protected outlets compared to CEC’s 24-inch wall-line spacing.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Determination**\n**CEC 2022 is more restrictive** than NEC 2023 for kitchen GFCI requirements:  \n- **No exceptions** for countertop receptacles in CEC.  \n- **Stricter spacing rules** (24-inch wall-line vs. 1.7 m² per receptacle).  \n- **Receptacle-level GFCI required**, while NEC allows circuit-level protection.  \n\n**Conclusion**: California’s CEC enforces broader and stricter GFCI requirements for kitchens, with no exceptions for countertop receptacles.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

Exceptions like those for \"listed combination devices\" (e.g., integrated appliances) **do not apply** to countertop receptacles in kitchens.  \n\n2. **Limited Exceptions in Related Sections**:  \n   - **210.8(A)(5)**: Allows exceptions for fire alarm systems in basements, but this does not apply to kitchens.  \n   - **210.52(C)(1) Exception**: Exempts receptacles directly behind ranges or sinks, but **only for wall-line spacing**, not GFCI requirements.  \n\n3. **Strict Receptacle-Level GFCI**:  \n   CEC mandates **individual receptacles** must have GFCI protection (no circuit-level exceptions for kitchens).  \n\n---\n\n### **NEC 2023 Exceptions**\n1. **Permits Listed Combination Devices**:  \n   NEC 210.8(A)(6) allows exceptions for **listed combination devices** (e.g., countertop receptacles integrated into appliances like microwaves).  \n\n2. **Circuit-Level GFCI Protection**:  \n   NEC permits GFCI protection at the **circuit level** (e.g., a GFCI breaker) instead of individual receptacles.  \n\n3. **Flexibility in Spacing**:  \n   NEC uses a **1.7 m² (18 ft²)** rule for countertop receptacles, which allows fewer GFCI-protected outlets compared to CEC’s 24-inch wall-line spacing.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Determination**\n**CEC 2022 is more restrictive** than NEC 2023 for kitchen GFCI requirements:  \n- **No exceptions** for countertop receptacles in CEC.  \n- **Stricter spacing rules** (24-inch wall-line vs. 1.7 m² per receptacle).  \n- **Receptacle-level GFCI required**, while NEC allows circuit-level protection.  \n\n**Conclusion**: California’s CEC enforces broader and stricter GFCI requirements for kitchens, with no exceptions for countertop receptacles.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

The core PV requirements align with NEC but include state-specific exceptions and stricter residential voltage limits.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",
