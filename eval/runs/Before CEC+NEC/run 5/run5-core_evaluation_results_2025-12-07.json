The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

However, California allows flexibility in SPD installation location via an exception.\n\n---\n\n### Key Details from CEC 2022:\n- **Section 230.67(A):**  \n  All services supplying dwelling units **must** have a surge-protective device (SPD).\n\n- **Exception to Location Requirement (Section 230.67(B)):**  \n  The SPD **does not need to be in the service equipment** if installed at the **next level of distribution equipment downstream** toward the load. This allows installation in a distribution panel rather than the main service panel.\n\n- **Type Requirement (Section 230.67(C)):**  \n  SPDs must be **Type 1 or Type 2** devices.\n\n---\n\n### Additional CEC Exceptions:\n- **Section 230.94:**  \n  Permits SPDs (Type 1) to be installed on the **supply side of the service disconnecting means** under specific conditions (e.g., metering, fire alarm circuits).\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Requirement:** SPDs are mandatory for residential services (CEC 2022 §230.67).  \n- **Flexibility:** SPDs can be installed downstream of the service equipment (Exception to §230.67(B)).  \n- **No Direct Exceptions:** No exemptions for residential services based on service size (200A) or location type.\n\nThis aligns with NEC 2023 but emphasizes California's specific wording and exceptions.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

This is **non-negotiable** for feeders (unlike single branch circuits, which have exceptions).  \n\n2. **Equipment Grounding Conductor (EGC)**  \n   - The feeder must include an EGC sized per **Table 250.122** (based on the overcurrent device rating). This conductor connects to the subpanel’s grounding bar and the local grounding electrode.  \n\n3. **Neutral-Ground Separation**  \n   - In the subpanel, **neutral and ground bars must be isolated** (not bonded). The neutral conductor from the feeder connects only to the neutral bar. This prevents the neutral from acting as a grounding path, as required by **250.32(B)(1)**.  \n\n4. **Grounding Electrode Conductor (GEC)**  \n   - A separate GEC connects the subpanel’s grounding bar to the local electrode. Its size is determined by **Table 250.66** based on the largest ungrounded (hot) conductor in the feeder.  \n\n5. **No Neutral-to-Ground Bond**  \n   - The grounded (neutral) conductor from the feeder **must not** connect to the grounding electrode or subpanel’s grounding system. This avoids parallel paths for fault currents.  \n\n---\n\n### Exceptions Checked  \n- **250.142** allows using the grounded conductor for grounding in specific cases (e.g., single branch circuits), but **does not apply here** because the garage is fed by a feeder.  \n- **250.134** exceptions for DC circuits or separately run EGCs are irrelevant in this AC feeder scenario.  \n\n---\n\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \nThe NEC has **identical requirements** for detached structures supplied by feeders. Key differences in CEC:  \n- **[CEC]** explicitly requires a grounding electrode for all detached structures, while NEC allows exceptions for small branch circuits (not applicable here).  \n- **[CEC]** enforces stricter neutral-ground separation in subpanels to prevent bonding errors.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

This is **non-negotiable** for feeders (unlike single branch circuits, which have exceptions).  \n\n2. **Equipment Grounding Conductor (EGC)**  \n   - The feeder must include an EGC sized per **Table 250.122** (based on the overcurrent device rating). This conductor connects to the subpanel’s grounding bar and the local grounding electrode.  \n\n3. **Neutral-Ground Separation**  \n   - In the subpanel, **neutral and ground bars must be isolated** (not bonded). The neutral conductor from the feeder connects only to the neutral bar. This prevents the neutral from acting as a grounding path, as required by **250.32(B)(1)**.  \n\n4. **Grounding Electrode Conductor (GEC)**  \n   - A separate GEC connects the subpanel’s grounding bar to the local electrode. Its size is determined by **Table 250.66** based on the largest ungrounded (hot) conductor in the feeder.  \n\n5. **No Neutral-to-Ground Bond**  \n   - The grounded (neutral) conductor from the feeder **must not** connect to the grounding electrode or subpanel’s grounding system. This avoids parallel paths for fault currents.  \n\n---\n\n### Exceptions Checked  \n- **250.142** allows using the grounded conductor for grounding in specific cases (e.g., single branch circuits), but **does not apply here** because the garage is fed by a feeder.  \n- **250.134** exceptions for DC circuits or separately run EGCs are irrelevant in this AC feeder scenario.  \n\n---\n\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \nThe NEC has **identical requirements** for detached structures supplied by feeders. Key differences in CEC:  \n- **[CEC]** explicitly requires a grounding electrode for all detached structures, while NEC allows exceptions for small branch circuits (not applicable here).  \n- **[CEC]** enforces stricter neutral-ground separation in subpanels to prevent bonding errors.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n",

The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

It detects arcing conditions that standard breakers cannot, including series arcing (broken/damaged wires), parallel arcing (line-to-line or line-to-ground), loose connections, damaged insulation, and deteriorated wire.

      "answer": "## [Main Answer - CEC 2022]\nThe California Electrical Code (CEC) requires Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) protection for 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits in bedrooms, living rooms, and similar areas **to prevent electrical fires caused by dangerous arcing faults**. This requirement is adopted directly from NEC 2023 Section 210.12, with no additional amendments in the CEC.\n\n### Key CEC Requirements:\n- **Section 210.12(A)** mandates AFCI protection for all 120-volt, single-phase, 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits supplying outlets devices in:\n  - Bedrooms\n  - Living rooms\n  - Hallways\n  - Closets\n  - Bathrooms\n  - Similar habitable spaces\n\n### Exceptions in CEC 2022:\nAfter checking `cec_exception_search(\"210.12\", \"bedrooms and living areas\")`, **no exceptions** were found that modify the AFCI requirement for these areas. The exceptions returned relate to lighting outlets (Section 210.70) and receptacle spacing (Section 210.52), which are separate from AFCI protections.\n\n### Electrical Hazard Prevented:\nAFCIs detect and interrupt **series arcs** (e.g., from damaged wiring) and **parallel arcs** (e.g., from loose connections), which can reach temperatures exceeding 10,000°F and ignite surrounding materials. Standard circuit breakers do not detect these arcs, making AFCIs critical for fire prevention in areas with embedded wiring.\n\n---\n## NEC 2023 Reference\nThe NEC requirement is identical to the CEC. No differences exist between CEC 2022 and NEC 2023 for this requirement.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

This requirement is adopted directly from NEC 2023 Section 210.12, with no additional amendments in the CEC.\n\n### Key CEC Requirements:\n- **Section 210.12(A)** mandates AFCI protection for all 120-volt, single-phase, 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits supplying outlets devices in:\n  - Bedrooms\n  - Living rooms\n  - Hallways\n  - Closets\n  - Bathrooms\n  - Similar habitable spaces\n\n### Exceptions in CEC 2022:\nAfter checking `cec_exception_search(\"210.12\", \"bedrooms and living areas\")`, **no exceptions** were found that modify the AFCI requirement for these areas. The exceptions returned relate to lighting outlets (Section 210.70) and receptacle spacing (Section 210.52), which are separate from AFCI protections.\n\n### Electrical Hazard Prevented:\nAFCIs detect and interrupt **series arcs** (e.g., from damaged wiring) and **parallel arcs** (e.g., from loose connections), which can reach temperatures exceeding 10,000°F and ignite surrounding materials. Standard circuit breakers do not detect these arcs, making AFCIs critical for fire prevention in areas with embedded wiring.\n\n---\n## NEC 2023 Reference\nThe NEC requirement is identical to the CEC. No differences exist between CEC 2022 and NEC 2023 for this requirement.\n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",

Insufficient Depth Clearance (Violation of CEC 110.26(A)(1))**\n- **Measured:** 28 inches  \n- **Required:** 30 inches (Table 110.26(A)(1), *Condition 2* for residential panels with grounded parts on one side).  \n- **Exception Check:**  \n  - **Exception No. 2** (CEC 110.26(A)(1)(c)) allows reduced clearance in existing dwellings for panels ≤ 200A.  \n  - **However, this exception does NOT waive the 30-inch depth requirement**—it only permits reduced *height* clearance.  \n  - **Result:** Depth violation remains unaddressed by exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Obstruction in Working Space (Violation of CEC 110.26(B))**\n- **Issue:** Water heater located 16 inches from the panel (within the required 30-inch depth).  \n- **Violation:** Storage or obstructions are strictly prohibited in working space (CEC 110.26(B)).  \n- **Exception Check:** No exceptions apply—obstructions are explicitly forbidden regardless of panel size or location.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Insufficient Vertical Height Clearance (Violation of CEC 110.26(A)(3))**\n- **Measured:** 5 feet (60 inches)  \n- **Required:** 6.5 feet (78 inches) vertically from floor to top of working space.  \n- **Exception Check:**  \n  - **Exception No. 2** (CEC 110.26(A)(1)(c)) permits reduced *height* clearance in existing dwellings for panels ≤ 200A.  \n  - **However, this exception does NOT apply to the vertical height requirement**—only to depth and width in specific scenarios.  \n  - **Result:** Vertical height violation remains unaddressed by exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Panel Height Compliance (No Direct Violation)**\n- **Measured:** 5 feet (60 inches)  \n- **Requirement:** No specific height limit for panel installation, but working space must extend to 6.5 feet.  \n- **Conclusion:** Panel height itself is not a violation, but the working space above it is insufficient.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Entrance Access (Pending Verification)**\n- **Requirement:** At least one entrance of **24 inches (610 mm) wide × 6.5 feet (2.0 m) high** must be provided (CEC 110.26(C)(1)).  \n- **Pending Check:** If panel doors restrict access to less than 24 inches wide or 6.5 feet high, this would violate clearance requirements.  \n- **Note:** User did not specify door dimensions—requires on-site verification.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of CEC Violations**\n| **Violation**                | **CEC Section**       | **Status** |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|\n| Depth clearance (28\" < 30\")  | 110.26(A)(1)           | Violation   |\n| Obstruction (water heater)   | 110.26(B)              | Violation   |\n| Vertical height (5' < 6.5')| 110.26(A)(3)           | Violation   |\n| Entrance access              | 110.26(C)(1)           | *Pending*   |\n\n---\n\n### **Corrective Actions**\n1. **Increase Depth Clearance:** Relocate the panel or remove obstructions to achieve **30 inches** of unobstructed depth.  \n2. **Remove/Relocate Water Heater:** Clear all objects from the working space to comply with 110.26(B).  \n3. **Raise Working Space Height:** Ensure the working space extends **6.5 feet vertically** from the floor.  \n4. **Verify Entrance Dimensions:** Confirm entrances meet **24\" × 6.5'** requirements for unimpeded access.  \n\n---\n\n### **NEC Comparison**\n- **NEC 2023** has identical requirements for working space depth (30 inches for Condition 2) and prohibits obstructions (110.26(B)).  \n- **No California-specific amendments** to these requirements in CEC 2022.  \n\n**✓ Sources:** CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",

The panel’s installation height does not affect this requirement—the working space itself is too short.\n\n3. **Obstruction in Working Space**  \n   - **Issue:** Water heater located 16 inches to the left of the panel.  \n   - **Violation:** NEC 110.26(B) prohibits storage or obstructions in working space. The water heater invades the required 30-inch depth clearance and blocks safe access/maintenance.  \n\n4. **Panel Height Compliance**  \n   - **Measured:** 5 feet (60 inches)  \n   - **Requirement:** No specific height limit for panel installation, but working space must be unobstructed up to 6.5 feet. The panel’s height itself is not a violation, but the working space above it is insufficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Considerations:**\n- **Entrance Requirements:**  \n  - At least one entrance of **24 inches (610 mm) wide × 6.5 feet (2.0 m) high** must be provided (NEC 110.26(C)(1)). If the panel’s enclosure doors restrict access to less than this, it violates clearance requirements.  \n  - *Note:* The user did not specify door dimensions, but if doors open inward or restrict access, this could compound the violation.\n\n- **Exception for Existing Dwellings:**  \n  - Exception No. 2 in NEC 110.26(A)(1) permits reduced height clearance in existing dwelling units for panels ≤ 200A. However, **depth and obstruction violations remain** regardless of exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Violations**\n| **Violation**                | **NEC Section**       | **Status** |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| Depth clearance (28\" < 30\")  | 110.26(A)(1)         | Violation   |\n| Height clearance (5' < 6.5') | 110.26(A)(3)         | Violation   |\n| Obstruction (water heater)  | 110.26(B)            | Violation   |\n| Entrance access               | 110.26(C)(1)         | *Pending*   |\n\n---\n\n### **Corrective Actions**\n1. **Increase Depth Clearance:** Relocate the panel or remove obstructions to achieve **30 inches** of unobstructed depth.  \n2. **Raise Working Space Height:** Ensure the working space extends **6.5 feet vertically** from the floor.  \n3. **Remove/Relocate Water Heater:** Clear all objects from the working space to comply with 110.26(B).  \n4. **Verify Entrance Dimensions:** Confirm entrances meet **24\" × 6.5'** requirements for unimpeded access.  \n\n**✓ Sources:** NEC 2023 (reference)",

Insufficient Depth Clearance (Violation of CEC 110.26(A)(1))**\n- **Measured:** 28 inches  \n- **Required:** 30 inches (Table 110.26(A)(1), *Condition 2* for residential panels with grounded parts on one side).  \n- **Exception Check:**  \n  - **Exception No. 2** (CEC 110.26(A)(1)(c)) allows reduced clearance in existing dwellings for panels ≤ 200A.  \n  - **However, this exception does NOT waive the 30-inch depth requirement**—it only permits reduced *height* clearance.  \n  - **Result:** Depth violation remains unaddressed by exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Obstruction in Working Space (Violation of CEC 110.26(B))**\n- **Issue:** Water heater located 16 inches from the panel (within the required 30-inch depth).  \n- **Violation:** Storage or obstructions are strictly prohibited in working space (CEC 110.26(B)).  \n- **Exception Check:** No exceptions apply—obstructions are explicitly forbidden regardless of panel size or location.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Insufficient Vertical Height Clearance (Violation of CEC 110.26(A)(3))**\n- **Measured:** 5 feet (60 inches)  \n- **Required:** 6.5 feet (78 inches) vertically from floor to top of working space.  \n- **Exception Check:**  \n  - **Exception No. 2** (CEC 110.26(A)(1)(c)) permits reduced *height* clearance in existing dwellings for panels ≤ 200A.  \n  - **However, this exception does NOT apply to the vertical height requirement**—only to depth and width in specific scenarios.  \n  - **Result:** Vertical height violation remains unaddressed by exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Panel Height Compliance (No Direct Violation)**\n- **Measured:** 5 feet (60 inches)  \n- **Requirement:** No specific height limit for panel installation, but working space must extend to 6.5 feet.  \n- **Conclusion:** Panel height itself is not a violation, but the working space above it is insufficient.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Entrance Access (Pending Verification)**\n- **Requirement:** At least one entrance of **24 inches (610 mm) wide × 6.5 feet (2.0 m) high** must be provided (CEC 110.26(C)(1)).  \n- **Pending Check:** If panel doors restrict access to less than 24 inches wide or 6.5 feet high, this would violate clearance requirements.  \n- **Note:** User did not specify door dimensions—requires on-site verification.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of CEC Violations**\n| **Violation**                | **CEC Section**       | **Status** |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|\n| Depth clearance (28\" < 30\")  | 110.26(A)(1)           | Violation   |\n| Obstruction (water heater)   | 110.26(B)              | Violation   |\n| Vertical height (5' < 6.5')| 110.26(A)(3)           | Violation   |\n| Entrance access              | 110.26(C)(1)           | *Pending*   |\n\n---\n\n### **Corrective Actions**\n1. **Increase Depth Clearance:** Relocate the panel or remove obstructions to achieve **30 inches** of unobstructed depth.  \n2. **Remove/Relocate Water Heater:** Clear all objects from the working space to comply with 110.26(B).  \n3. **Raise Working Space Height:** Ensure the working space extends **6.5 feet vertically** from the floor.  \n4. **Verify Entrance Dimensions:** Confirm entrances meet **24\" × 6.5'** requirements for unimpeded access.  \n\n---\n\n### **NEC Comparison**\n- **NEC 2023** has identical requirements for working space depth (30 inches for Condition 2) and prohibits obstructions (110.26(B)).  \n- **No California-specific amendments** to these requirements in CEC 2022.  \n\n**✓ Sources:** CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)",

Bonding neutral and ground bars in a subpanel creates a parallel path for neutral current, risking equipment damage and improper GFCI operation.  \n   - **Correct:** Neutral and ground bars must be **separated** in subpanels. The main bonding jumper (connecting neutral/ground) exists **only** in the main service panel.\n\n2. **Violation: Neutral Bar Bonded to Metal Enclosure**  \n   - **CEC 2022 Section 250.4(A)(5):** The neutral (grounded) conductor must not be connected to normally non-current-carrying metal parts in subpanels. Bonding the neutral bar to the enclosure creates a ground loop and violates the requirement for an effective ground-fault current path.  \n   - **Correct:** Neutral bar must remain **electrically isolated** from the metal enclosure in subpanels. Only the **ground bar** should be bonded to the enclosure.\n\n3. **Violation: Ground Bar Bonded to Metal Enclosure (Improper Method)**  \n   - **CEC 2022 Section 250.104:** Equipment grounding must use a **listed bonding jumper** (not a main bonding jumper). While bonding the ground bar to the enclosure is correct, the method must comply with 250.104(A)(1) (e.g., direct metal-to-metal contact with a listed bonding jumper).  \n   - **Correct:** Ensure the ground bar is bonded to the enclosure using a **listed bonding jumper** (not a main bonding jumper).\n\n4. **Violation: Feeder Neutral Connected to Neutral Bar (Improper Grounding Path)**  \n   - **CEC 2022 Section 250.24(C)(5):** The neutral conductor must not carry ground-fault current. If the neutral bar is bonded to the enclosure (as in this case), the feeder neutral becomes part of the ground-fault path, violating 250.4(A)(5).  \n   - **Correct:** Feeder neutral connects to the **neutral bar** (isolated from ground), and the feeder ground connects to the **ground bar** (bonded to enclosure). A separate grounding electrode conductor (e.g., ground rod) must connect the subpanel to a local grounding electrode per 250.50.\n\n---\n\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \nNo difference from NEC 2023.
