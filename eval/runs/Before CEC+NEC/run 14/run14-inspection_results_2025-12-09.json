      "question": "Residential panel inspection: 200A main breaker. Installed loads: (1) 12kW electric range on 40A breaker, (2) 5.5kW dryer on 30A breaker, (3) two 20A small appliance circuits, (4) one 20A laundry circuit, (5) 3000 sq ft living space with general lighting, (6) 4-ton central AC (19.2A at 240V, approximately 4600W). Calculate the service load per NEC Article 220 and determine if the 200A panel is adequately sized. Show your work.",
      "expected_answer": "General lighting: 3000 sq ft × 3 VA = 9000 VA. Small appliance: 2 circuits × 1500 VA = 3000 VA. Laundry: 1500 VA. Subtotal: 13,500 VA. Apply demand factor per Table 220.42: first 3000 VA at 100% = 3000 VA, remaining 10,500 VA at 35% = 3675 VA. Subtotal with demand: 6675 VA. Range: 8000 VA (per Table 220.55 for one range). Dryer: 5500 VA at 100%. AC: 4600 VA at 100% (largest motor). Total: 6675 + 8000 + 5500 + 4600 = 24,775 VA. Current: 24,775 VA ÷ 240V = 103.2A.

The one-way distance from the panel to the load is 50 feet. Calculate the voltage drop in volts and as a percentage. Does this meet NEC recommendations (3% maximum for branch circuits)?",
      "expected_answer": "Voltage drop formula: VD = (2 × L × R × I) / 1000. Where: L = 50 feet (one-way distance), R = 1.29 ohms/1000ft for 12 AWG copper (Chapter 9 Table 8), I = 22 amperes, multiply by 2 for round trip. Calculation: VD = (2 × 50 × 1.29 × 22) / 1000 = 2,838 / 1000 = 2.84 volts. Percentage: (2.84V / 120V) × 100 = 2.37%.
