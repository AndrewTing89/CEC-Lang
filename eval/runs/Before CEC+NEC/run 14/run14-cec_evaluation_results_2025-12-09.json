      "answer": "## Medium Voltage Cable Tables in CEC 2022 (Not in NEC)\n\nCalifornia's CEC 2022 includes **18 dedicated medium voltage (MV) cable ampacity tables** not found in the NEC. These are:\n\n- **Tables 311.60(C)(67) through 311.60(C)(86)**  \n  Provide ampacities for **Type MV cables rated 2001–35,000 volts** installed in cable trays, underground ducts, and direct burial. Key applications include:\n  - **Cable trays**: Triplexed, isolated, or conduit-installed cables (Tables 67–76)\n  - **Underground ducts**: Three-conductor or single-conductor cables (Tables 77–80)\n  - **Direct burial**: Single or three-conductor cables (Tables 81–86)\n\n### Exceptions and Limiting Rules\n1. **Ambient Temperature Corrections** (311.60(D)(4)):  \n   Ampacities must be adjusted for temperatures other than 40°C using correction factors or the provided equation.\n\n2. **Shield Grounding**:  \n   For cables with shields grounded at multiple points (Tables 69, 70, 81, 82), ampacities must be derated due to shield currents (Exception 311.60(D)(1)).\n\n3. **Burial Depth Adjustments**:  \n   Deeper burial than table values allows a 6% ampacity reduction per 1 ft (300 mm) depth increase (311.60(D)(2)(b)).\n\n4. **Conductor Temperature Limits**:  \n   Refer to **Table 311.10(A)** for maximum operating temperatures based on insulation type.\n\n5. **Engineering Supervision**:  \n   Tables may be overridden by engineering calculations under qualified supervision (311.60(A)(1)).\n\nThese tables are explicitly mandated for MV systems in California, whereas the NEC relies on engineering calculations for such applications. Always verify installation conditions (e.g., burial depth, shielding) against the table footnotes and cross-referenced sections.\n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Sections 311.60, 311.10, and 311.60(D)",

Key applications include:\n  - **Cable trays**: Triplexed, isolated, or conduit-installed cables (Tables 67–76)\n  - **Underground ducts**: Three-conductor or single-conductor cables (Tables 77–80)\n  - **Direct burial**: Single or three-conductor cables (Tables 81–86)\n\n### Exceptions and Limiting Rules\n1. **Ambient Temperature Corrections** (311.60(D)(4)):  \n   Ampacities must be adjusted for temperatures other than 40°C using correction factors or the provided equation.\n\n2. **Shield Grounding**:  \n   For cables with shields grounded at multiple points (Tables 69, 70, 81, 82), ampacities must be derated due to shield currents (Exception 311.60(D)(1)).\n\n3. **Burial Depth Adjustments**:  \n   Deeper burial than table values allows a 6% ampacity reduction per 1 ft (300 mm) depth increase (311.60(D)(2)(b)).\n\n4. **Conductor Temperature Limits**:  \n   Refer to **Table 311.10(A)** for maximum operating temperatures based on insulation type.\n\n5. **Engineering Supervision**:  \n   Tables may be overridden by engineering calculations under qualified supervision (311.60(A)(1)).\n\nThese tables are explicitly mandated for MV systems in California, whereas the NEC relies on engineering calculations for such applications. Always verify installation conditions (e.g., burial depth, shielding) against the table footnotes and cross-referenced sections.\n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Sections 311.60, 311.10, and 311.60(D)",

The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

For **hermetic refrigerant motor-compressors** or **multimotor equipment**, special rules in 440.6 may override standard ampacity calculations using nameplate data instead of Table 310.16 values.\n\n4. **California Amendment**:  \n   - The value includes [CEC] amendments to NEC Table 310.16.

Ampacities result from consideration of one or more of the following:\n\n- (1) Temperature compatibility with connected equipment, especially the connection points.\n\n- (2) Coordination with circuit and system overcurrent protection.\n\n- (3) Compliance with the requirements of product listings or certifications. See 110.3(B).\n\n- (4) Preservation of the safety benefits of established industry practices and standardized procedures.\n\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For conductor area see Chapter 9, Table 8, Conductor Properties. Interpolation is based on the conductor area and not the conductor overall area.\n\nInformational Note No. 3: For the ampacities of flexible cords and cables, see 400.5. For the ampacities of fixture wires, see 402.5.\n\nInformational Note No. 4: For explanation of type letters used in tables and for recognized sizes of conductors for the various conductor insulations, see Table 310.4(A) and Table 310.4(B). For installation requirements, see 310.1 through 310.14 and the various articles of this Code .

The ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced as shown in Table 310.15(C)(1) where the number of current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable exceeds three, or where single conductors or multiconductor cables not installed in raceways are installed without maintaining spacing for a continuous length longer than 600 mm (24  in.). Each current-carrying conductor of a paralleled set of conductors shall be counted as a current- carrying conductor. N\n\n\nWhere conductors of different systems, as provided in 300.3, are installed in a common raceway or cable, the adjustment factors shown in Table 310.15(C)(1) shall apply only to the number of power and lighting conductors (Articles 210, 215, 220, and 230).\n\nInformational Note No. 1: See Annex B for adjustment factors for more than three current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable with load diversity.\n\nInformational Note No.  2: See 366.23 for adjustment factors for conductors and ampacity for bare copper and aluminum bars in auxiliary gutters and 376.22(B) for adjustment factors for conductors in metal wireways.\n\n(a) Where conductors are installed in cable trays, the provisions of 392.80 shall apply.\n\n(b) Adjustment factors shall not apply to conductors in raceways having a length not exceeding 600 mm (24 in.).\n\n(c) Adjustment factors shall not apply to underground conductors entering or leaving an outdoor trench if those conductors have physical protection in the form of rigid metal conduit, intermediate metal conduit, rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit (PVC), or reinforced thermosetting resin conduit (RTRC) having a length not exceeding 3.05 m (10 ft), and if the number of conductors does not exceed four.\n\n(d) Adjustment factors shall not apply to Type AC cable or to Type MC cable under the following conditions:\n\n- (1) The cables do not have an overall outer jacket.\n\n- (2) Each cable has not more than three current-carrying conductors.\n\n- (3) The conductors are 12 AWG copper.\n\n- (4) Not more than 20 current-carrying conductors are installed without maintaining spacing, are stacked, or are supported on 'bridle rings.'\n\n\nException to (4): If cables meeting the requirements in 310.15(C) (1)(d)(1) through (C)(1)(d)(3) with more than 20  current-carrying conductors are installed longer than 600  mm (24  in.) without maintaining spacing, are stacked, or are supported on bridle rings, a 60 percent adjustment factor shall be applied.\n\n- (2) Raceway Spacing. Spacing between raceways shall be maintained. N\n\n\n##### (D) Bare or Covered Conductors. Where bare or covered conductors are installed with insulated conductors, the temperature rating of the bare or covered conductor shall be equal to the lowest temperature rating of the insulated conductors for the purpose of determining ampacity.\n\n\n##### (E) Neutral Conductor. Neutral conductors shall be considered current carrying in accordance with any of the following: ∆\n\n- (1) A neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be required to be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (2) In a 3-wire circuit consisting of two phase conductors and the neutral conductor of a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system, a common conductor carries approximately the same current as the line-to-neutral load currents of the other conductors and shall be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (3) On a 4-wire, 3-phase wye circuit where the major portion of the load consists of nonlinear loads, harmonic currents are present in the neutral conductor; the neutral conductor shall therefore be considered a current-carrying conductor.\n\n##### (F) Grounding or Bonding Conductor. A grounding or bonding conductor shall not be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1). ∆\n\nException 4 [CEC 2022 Section 310.14] (relevance: 0.25)\n#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts\n\n\n##### (A) General.\n\n- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

The ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced as shown in Table 310.15(C)(1) where the number of current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable exceeds three, or where single conductors or multiconductor cables not installed in raceways are installed without maintaining spacing for a continuous length longer than 600 mm (24  in.). Each current-carrying conductor of a paralleled set of conductors shall be counted as a current- carrying conductor. N\n\n\nWhere conductors of different systems, as provided in 300.3, are installed in a common raceway or cable, the adjustment factors shown in Table 310.15(C)(1) shall apply only to the number of power and lighting conductors (Articles 210, 215, 220, and 230).\n\nInformational Note No. 1: See Annex B for adjustment factors for more than three current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable with load diversity.\n\nInformational Note No.  2: See 366.23 for adjustment factors for conductors and ampacity for bare copper and aluminum bars in auxiliary gutters and 376.22(B) for adjustment factors for conductors in metal wireways.\n\n(a) Where conductors are installed in cable trays, the provisions of 392.80 shall apply.\n\n(b) Adjustment factors shall not apply to conductors in raceways having a length not exceeding 600 mm (24 in.).\n\n(c) Adjustment factors shall not apply to underground conductors entering or leaving an outdoor trench if those conductors have physical protection in the form of rigid metal conduit, intermediate metal conduit, rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit (PVC), or reinforced thermosetting resin conduit (RTRC) having a length not exceeding 3.05 m (10 ft), and if the number of conductors does not exceed four.\n\n(d) Adjustment factors shall not apply to Type AC cable or to Type MC cable under the following conditions:\n\n- (1) The cables do not have an overall outer jacket.\n\n- (2) Each cable has not more than three current-carrying conductors.\n\n- (3) The conductors are 12 AWG copper.\n\n- (4) Not more than 20 current-carrying conductors are installed without maintaining spacing, are stacked, or are supported on 'bridle rings.'\n\n\nException to (4): If cables meeting the requirements in 310.15(C) (1)(d)(1) through (C)(1)(d)(3) with more than 20  current-carrying conductors are installed longer than 600  mm (24  in.) without maintaining spacing, are stacked, or are supported on bridle rings, a 60 percent adjustment factor shall be applied.\n\n- (2) Raceway Spacing. Spacing between raceways shall be maintained. N\n\n\n##### (D) Bare or Covered Conductors. Where bare or covered conductors are installed with insulated conductors, the temperature rating of the bare or covered conductor shall be equal to the lowest temperature rating of the insulated conductors for the purpose of determining ampacity.\n\n\n##### (E) Neutral Conductor. Neutral conductors shall be considered current carrying in accordance with any of the following: ∆\n\n- (1) A neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be required to be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (2) In a 3-wire circuit consisting of two phase conductors and the neutral conductor of a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system, a common conductor carries approximately the same current as the line-to-neutral load currents of the other conductors and shall be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (3) On a 4-wire, 3-phase wye circuit where the major portion of the load consists of nonlinear loads, harmonic currents are present in the neutral conductor; the neutral conductor shall therefore be considered a current-carrying conductor.\n\n##### (F) Grounding or Bonding Conductor. A grounding or bonding conductor shall not be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1). ∆\n\nException 4 [CEC 2022 Section 310.14] (relevance: 0.25)\n#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts\n\n\n##### (A) General.\n\n- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nException 5 [CEC 2022 Section 427.45] (relevance: 0.17)\n#### 427.45 Conductor Ampacity\n\nThe ampacity of the electrically insulated conductor inside the ferromagnetic envelope shall be ∆\n\npermitted to exceed the values given in Table 310.16, provided it is identified as suitable for this use.\n",

It mandates GFCI protection for **sink areas with food preparation** (e.g., dishwashers, sinks with disposals), which CEC 2022 does not explicitly cover.  \n2. Its language explicitly includes **\"areas with sinks and permanent provisions for food preparation\"**, expanding coverage beyond countertops.  \n3. Fewer exceptions for standard kitchen circuits compared to CEC.  \n\n**Example**: A receptacle near a sink for a dishwasher requires GFCI under NEC but not CEC unless it’s within 6 ft of the sink (covered under 210.8(A)(7)).  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

      "answer": "## Final Answer: California EV Charging Requirements vs NEC 2023 (CEC 2022)\n\n### **Key Differences with Exceptions Considered**\n\n1. **Dedicated Branch Circuits (CEC 625.40)**  \n   - **CEC**: *No exceptions* apply to the dedicated branch circuit requirement for EV charging. Each EV outlet must have its own circuit with no other outlets.  \n   - **NEC 210.24**: Permits shared circuits but requires dedicated circuits for EVSE if supplied by a branch circuit rated ≥ 20A.  \n\n2. **Ground-Fault Protection (CEC 625.54)**  \n   - **CEC**: Mandates GFCI protection for all EV receptacles (no exceptions).  \n   - **NEC 210.8(B)(9)**: Requires GFCI for EVSE receptacles rated ≤ 150V to ground.  \n\n3. **Ventilation (CEC 625.52)**  \n   - **CEC**: No exceptions to mechanical ventilation requirements for indoor EV charging. Ventilation must be interlocked with EVSE power.  \n   - **NEC**: No ventilation requirements.  \n\n4. **CALGreen Mandates (CEC 625.1.1)**  \n   - **CEC**: New construction must include reserved panel spaces, conduit to parking, and minimum 40A circuits.  \n   - **NEC**: No equivalent green building provisions.  \n\n5. **Panelboard Reservations (CEC 408.2)**  \n   - **CEC**: Requires reserved spaces for EV circuits in new panelboards.  \n   - **NEC**: No such requirement.  \n\n---\n\n**Exceptions Check**:  \n- Searched exceptions for **CEC 625.40** (dedicated circuits) but found no applicable exceptions. The returned exceptions (230.40) relate to service-entrance conductors, not EV branch circuits.  \n\n**Conclusion**: California imposes stricter, more comprehensive requirements for EV infrastructure, including ventilation, green building mandates, and panelboard reservations, with no exceptions to core EV safety rules like dedicated circuits or GFCI protection.",

Each EV outlet must have its own circuit with no other outlets.  \n   - **NEC 210.24**: Permits shared circuits but requires dedicated circuits for EVSE if supplied by a branch circuit rated ≥ 20A.  \n\n2. **Ground-Fault Protection (CEC 625.54)**  \n   - **CEC**: Mandates GFCI protection for all EV receptacles (no exceptions).  \n   - **NEC 210.8(B)(9)**: Requires GFCI for EVSE receptacles rated ≤ 150V to ground.  \n\n3. **Ventilation (CEC 625.52)**  \n   - **CEC**: No exceptions to mechanical ventilation requirements for indoor EV charging. Ventilation must be interlocked with EVSE power.  \n   - **NEC**: No ventilation requirements.  \n\n4. **CALGreen Mandates (CEC 625.1.1)**  \n   - **CEC**: New construction must include reserved panel spaces, conduit to parking, and minimum 40A circuits.  \n   - **NEC**: No equivalent green building provisions.  \n\n5. **Panelboard Reservations (CEC 408.2)**  \n   - **CEC**: Requires reserved spaces for EV circuits in new panelboards.  \n   - **NEC**: No such requirement.  \n\n---\n\n**Exceptions Check**:  \n- Searched exceptions for **CEC 625.40** (dedicated circuits) but found no applicable exceptions. The returned exceptions (230.40) relate to service-entrance conductors, not EV branch circuits.  \n\n**Conclusion**: California imposes stricter, more comprehensive requirements for EV infrastructure, including ventilation, green building mandates, and panelboard reservations, with no exceptions to core EV safety rules like dedicated circuits or GFCI protection.",

Requirements for controlled conductors shall apply to the following:\n- (1)  PV system dc circuits\n- (2)  Inverter output circuits originating from inverters located within the array boundary\nInformational Note:  The rapid shutdown function reduces the risk of electrical shock that dc circuits in a PV system could pose for firefighters. The ac output conductors from PV systems that include inverters will either be de-energized after shutdown initiation or will remain energized by other sources such as a utility service. To prevent PV arrays with attached inverters from having energized ac conductors within the PV array(s), those circuits are also specifically controlled after shutdown initiation.\n(B)  Controlled Limits.

Where an on-site standby generator is used to supply a fire pump, an additional disconnecting  means  and  an  associated  overcurrent  protective  device(s) shall be permitted.\n- (2)  Overcurrent Device Selection. Overcurrent devices shall comply with 695.4(B)(2)(a) or (B)(2)(b). ∆\n(a) Individual Sources .  Overcurrent protection for individual sources shall comply with the following:\n- (1)  Overcurrent  protective  device(s)  shall  be  rated  to  carry indefinitely the sum of the locked-rotor current of the largest fire pump motor and the full-load current of all of the other pump motors and accessory equipment. [ 20: 9.2.3.4] Where the locked-rotor current value does not correspond to  a  standard  overcurrent  device  size,  the  next  standard\novercurrent device size shall be used in accordance with 240.6. The requirement to carry the locked-rotor currents indefinitely shall not apply to conductors or devices other than overcurrent devices in the fire pump motor circuit(s).\nException:  The requirement to carry the locked-rotor currents indefinitely  shall  not  apply  to  feeder  overcurrent  protective devices installed in accordance with 695.3(C).\n- (2)  Overcurrent  protection  shall  be  provided  by  an  assembly  listed  for  fire  pump  service  and  complying  with  the following:\n- a.  The overcurrent protective device shall not open within 2 minutes at 600 percent of the full-load current of the fire pump motor(s).\n- b.  The overcurrent protective device shall not open with a re-start transient of 24 times the full-load current of the fire pump motor(s).\n- c.  The overcurrent protective device shall not open within 10 minutes at 300 percent of the full-load current of the fire pump motor(s).\n- d.  The trip point for circuit breakers shall not be field adjustable. [ 20: 9.2.3.4.1]\n(b) On-Site  Standby  Generators. Overcurrent  protective devices between an on-site standby generator and a fire pump controller shall be selected and sized to allow for instantaneous pickup of the full pump room load, but shall not be larger than the value selected to comply with 430.62 to provide short-circuit protection only. [ 20: 9.6.1.1]\n(3)  Disconnecting  Means. All  disconnecting  devices  that are  unique  to  the  fire  pump  loads  shall  comply  with  items 695.4(B)(3)(a) through (B)(3)(e).\n(a) Features and Location - Normal Power Source. The disconnecting means for the normal power source shall comply with all of the following: [ 20: 9.2.3.1]\n- (1)  Be identified as suitable for use as service equipment.\n- (2)  Be lockable in the closed position. The provision for locking or adding a lock to the disconnecting means shall be installed on or at the switch or circuit breaker used as the disconnecting  means  and  shall  remain  in  place  with  or without the lock installed.\n- (3) Not be located within the same enclosure, panelboard, switchboard, switchgear, or motor control center, with or without common bus, that supplies loads other than the fire pump.\n- (4)  Be located sufficiently remote from other building or other fire pump source disconnecting means such that inadvertent operation at the same time would be unlikely.\nException to 695.4(B)(3)(a):  For a multibuilding campus-style complex(s) installed under the provisions of 695.3(C), only the requirements in 695.4(B)(3)(a)(2) shall apply for normal power source disconnects.\n(b) Features and Location - On-Site Standby Generator. The disconnecting means for an on-site standby generator(s) used as the alternate power source shall be installed in accordance with\n700.10(B)(5) for emergency circuits and shall be lockable in the closed position. The provision for locking or adding a lock to the disconnecting means shall be installed on or at the switch or circuit breaker used as the disconnecting means and shall remain in place with or without the lock installed.\n- (c) Disconnect Marking. The disconnecting means shall be marked 'Fire Pump Disconnecting Means.' The letters shall be at least 25 mm (1 in.) in height, and they shall be visible without opening enclosure doors or covers. [ 20: 9.2.3.1(5)]\n- (d) Controller Marking. A placard shall be placed adjacent to the fire pump controller, stating the location of this disconnecting means and the location of the key (if the disconnecting means is locked). [ 20: 9.2.3.2]\n- (e) Supervision.
