      "answer": "## Torque Specifications for Conductor Terminations (CEC 2022)\n\n### **Why Torque Specifications Are Important**\n1. **Prevent Overheating and Fires**:  \n   - Improper torque (over- or under-tightened) increases resistance at connections, leading to **excessive heat** and potential **fires**.  \n   - Proper torque ensures **low-resistance, stable connections**.  \n\n2. **Compliance with Device Ratings**:  \n   - Termination points (e.g., panel lugs, breakers) are rated for specific torque values. Deviating from these values **voids the device's listing** and creates a safety hazard.  \n\n3. **Arcing and Corrosion Prevention**:  \n   - Loose connections can cause **arcing**, which degrades insulation and increases fire risk.  \n   - Proper torque minimizes **oxidation and corrosion** at connection points.  \n\n---\n\n### **Code Requirements**\n1. **CEC 110.14(D)**:  \n   > \"Tightening torque values for terminal connections shall be as indicated on equipment or in installation instructions provided by the manufacturer. An approved means shall be used to achieve the indicated torque value.\"  \n   - **Approved means** include torque tools, shear bolts, or breakaway-style devices with visual indicators.  \n\n2. **CEC 110.3(B)**:  \n   > \"All connections and splices shall be torqued to the manufacturer’s specifications.\"  \n   - Mandates use of **torque tools** (not hand tools) for all conductor terminations.  \n\n3. **CEC 110.14(C)**:  \n   - Specifies that **aluminum conductors** must use torque-rated devices and anti-oxidant compound (for California, see **Title 24 Part 6** for additional mandates).  \n\n---\n\n### **California (CEC 2022) Considerations**\n- **Title 24 Part 6** (Energy Efficiency):  \n  - Requires **torque-rated devices** for all panel and breaker connections to ensure long-term reliability.  \n- **CALGreen**:  \n  - No direct amendments to torque requirements but emphasizes energy-efficient, code-compliant installations.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Code Sections**\n1. **CEC 110.14(D)**: Torque values per manufacturer specifications.  \n2. **CEC 110.3(B)**: Torque to manufacturer specifications.  \n3. **CEC 110.14(C)**: Aluminum conductor requirements.  \n\n---\n\n### **Practical Implications**\n- **Torque Tools Required**:  \n  - Use **calibrated torque screwdrivers/wrenches** (e.g., 5–25 in-lbs range).  \n- **Manufacturer Instructions**:  \n  - Always follow the **panel/breaker manufacturer’s torque values** (typically 8–12 in-lbs for residential panels).  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- **Why Important**: Prevents overheating, arcing, and fire hazards by ensuring secure, low-resistance connections.  \n- **Code Basis**: CEC 110.14(D), 110.3(B), and 110.14(C).  \n- **California Mandates**: Title 24 Part 6 requires torque-rated devices for compliance.  \n\n**[OK] Source**: CEC 2022 Sections 110.14(D), 110.3(B), and 110.14(C)",
