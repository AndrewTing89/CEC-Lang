A single overcurrent protective  device,  where  required,  shall  be  permitted  to  protect  the PV modules, dc-to-dc converters, and conductors of each source circuit or the conductors of each output circuit. Where single overcurrent protection devices are used to protect source or output circuits, all overcurrent devices shall be placed in the same polarity for all circuits within a PV system. The overcurrent devices shall be accessible but shall not be required to be readily accessible. ∆\nInformational Note:  Due to improved ground-fault protection  required  in  PV  systems  by  690.41(B),  a  single overcurrent  protective  device  in  either  the  positive  or negative conductors of a PV system in combination with this ground-fault protection provides adequate overcurrent protection.\n(D)  Power Transformers. Overcurrent protection for a transformer  with  a  source(s)  on  each  side  shall  be  provided  in accordance with 450.3 by considering first one side of the transformer, then the other side of the transformer, as the primary.\nException:  A power transformer with a current rating on the side connected toward the interactive inverter output, not less than the rated continuous output current of the inverter, shall be permitted without overcurrent protection from the inverter.\n\nResult 9 [CEC 2022 Section 690.12] (relevance: 0.71)\n#### 690.12  Rapid Shutdown of PV Systems on Buildings.

Requirements for controlled conductors shall apply to the following:\n- (1)  PV system dc circuits\n- (2)  Inverter output circuits originating from inverters located within the array boundary\nInformational Note:  The rapid shutdown function reduces the risk of electrical shock that dc circuits in a PV system could pose for firefighters. The ac output conductors from PV systems that include inverters will either be de-energized after shutdown initiation or will remain energized by other sources such as a utility service. To prevent PV arrays with attached inverters from having energized ac conductors within the PV array(s), those circuits are also specifically controlled after shutdown initiation.\n(B)  Controlled Limits. The use of the term array boundary in this section is defined as 305 mm (1 ft) from the array in all directions. Controlled conductors outside the array boundary shall comply with 690.12(B)(1) and inside the array boundary shall comply with 690.12(B)(2).\n(1)  Outside  the  Array  Boundary.

Voltage shall be measured between any two conductors and between any conductor and ground.\n- (2)  Inside the Array Boundary. The PV system shall comply with one of the following: ∆\n- (1) A PV hazard control  system  listed  for  the  purpose  shall be  installed  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  included with the listing or field labeling.

Where not within sight or not within 3 m (10 ft) of the equipment, the disconnecting means or its remote operating device or the enclosure providing access to the disconnecting means shall be capable of being locked in accordance with 110.25. Equipment disconnecting means, where used, shall be one of the types in 690.13(E)(1) through (E)(5).\nEquipment disconnecting means, other than those complying with 690.33, shall be marked in accordance with the warning in 690.13(B) if the line and load terminals can be energized in the open position.\nInformational Note:  A common installation practice is to terminate PV source-side dc conductors in the same manner that utility source-side ac conductors are generally connected on the line side of a disconnecting means. This practice is more likely to de-  energize load-side terminals, blades, and fuses when the disconnect is in the open position and no energized sources are connected to the load side of the disconnect.\n- (D)  Type of Disconnecting Means. Where disconnects are required to isolate equipment, the disconnecting means shall be one of the following applicable types: N\n- (1)  An  equipment  disconnecting  means  in  accordance  with 690.15(C) shall be required to isolate dc circuits with a maximum circuit current over 30 amperes.\n- (2)  An isolating device in accordance with 690.15(B) shall be  permitted  for  circuits  other  than  those  covered  by 690.15(D)(1).\n",

Disconnecting  means  of  the  type  required  in 690.15(D) shall be provided to disconnect ac PV modules, fuses, dc-to-dc converters, inverters, and charge controllers from all conductors that are not solidly grounded. · ∆\n•\n(A)  Location. Isolating devices or equipment disconnecting means shall be installed in circuits connected to equipment at a location within the equipment, or within sight and within 3 m (10 ft) of the equipment. An equipment disconnecting means shall be permitted to be remote from the equipment where the equipment disconnecting means can be remotely operated from within 3 m (10 ft) of the equipment. Where disconnecting means of equipment operating above 30 volts are readily accessible to unqualified persons, any enclosure door or hinged cover that exposes live parts when open shall be locked or require a tool to open.\n- (B)  Isolating Device. An isolating device shall not be required to have an interrupting rating. Where an isolating device is not rated for interrupting the circuit current, it shall be marked 'Do Not Disconnect Under Load' or 'Not for Current Interrupting.' An isolating device shall not be required to simultaneously disconnect all current-carrying conductors of a circuit. The isolating device shall be one of the following: ∆\n- (1) A mating connector meeting the requirements of 690.33 and listed and identified for use with specific equipment\n- (2)  A finger-safe fuse holder\n- (3)  An isolating device that requires a tool to place the device in the open (off) position\n- (4)  An isolating device listed for the intended application\n- (C)  Equipment Disconnecting Means. Equipment disconnecting  means shall  have  ratings  sufficient  for  the  maximum circuit current, available fault current, and voltage that is available  at  the  terminals.

Equipment disconnecting means shall be externally operable without exposing the operator to contact with energized parts and shall indicate whether in the open (off) or closed (on) position. Where not within sight or not within 3 m (10 ft) of the equipment, the disconnecting means or its remote operating device or the enclosure providing access to the disconnecting means shall be capable of being locked in accordance with 110.25. Equipment disconnecting means, where used, shall be one of the types in 690.13(E)(1) through (E)(5).\nEquipment disconnecting means, other than those complying with 690.33, shall be marked in accordance with the warning in 690.13(B) if the line and load terminals can be energized in the open position.\nInformational Note:  A common installation practice is to terminate PV source-side dc conductors in the same manner that utility source-side ac conductors are generally connected on the line side of a disconnecting means. This practice is more likely to de-  energize load-side terminals, blades, and fuses when the disconnect is in the open position and no energized sources are connected to the load side of the disconnect.\n- (D)  Type of Disconnecting Means. Where disconnects are required to isolate equipment, the disconnecting means shall be one of the following applicable types: N\n- (1)  An  equipment  disconnecting  means  in  accordance  with 690.15(C) shall be required to isolate dc circuits with a maximum circuit current over 30 amperes.\n- (2)  An isolating device in accordance with 690.15(B) shall be  permitted  for  circuits  other  than  those  covered  by 690.15(D)(1).\n",

Over 8 3 /4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.\n\n4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.\n\n5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 1 3 /4 kW and used in instructional programs.\n\nTable 220.56 Demand Factors for Kitchen Equipment - Other Than Dwelling Unit(s)\n\n\n##### (B) General Loads.

These amendments affect how the table’s cross-references (e.g., to Articles 440, 760) are applied, particularly in:\n\n1. **Surge Arrester Grounding (242.54):**  \n   - Requires specific interconnections for transformer secondary systems, impacting overcurrent protection for related conductors (e.g., fire alarm circuits).\n\n2. **Transformer Secondary Conductors (240.21(C)):**  \n   - Limits reliance on primary overcurrent devices for secondary conductor protection, affecting applications like motor circuits referenced in Table 240.4(G).\n\n3. **Grounding Electrode Modifications (250.54):**  \n   - Permits auxiliary grounding electrodes, which may alter overcurrent protection designs for systems like control circuits.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCEC Table 240.4(G) itself has no explicit amendments, but **California’s delta notes and related sections enforce stricter interpretations** of referenced articles compared to NEC.

These amendments affect how the table’s cross-references (e.g., to Articles 440, 760) are applied, particularly in:\n\n1. **Surge Arrester Grounding (242.54):**  \n   - Requires specific interconnections for transformer secondary systems, impacting overcurrent protection for related conductors (e.g., fire alarm circuits).\n\n2. **Transformer Secondary Conductors (240.21(C)):**  \n   - Limits reliance on primary overcurrent devices for secondary conductor protection, affecting applications like motor circuits referenced in Table 240.4(G).\n\n3. **Grounding Electrode Modifications (250.54):**  \n   - Permits auxiliary grounding electrodes, which may alter overcurrent protection designs for systems like control circuits.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCEC Table 240.4(G) itself has no explicit amendments, but **California’s delta notes and related sections enforce stricter interpretations** of referenced articles compared to NEC.

These tables provide ampacity values for various installation methods and configurations. Below are the key CEC-specific tables and their scope:\n\n---\n\n### **1. CEC 311.60(C)(67)–(C)(86): Medium Voltage Cable Ampacities**\nThese tables cover **insulated single and three-conductor copper and aluminum cables** for medium voltage (2001–35,000 volts) in different installation scenarios:\n\n#### **Installation Methods Covered:**\n- **Triplexed cables in air** (C67–C74):  \n  - Single or three-conductor cables triplexed (three cables twisted together) in air or isolated conduits.  \n  - Includes copper and aluminum conductors.  \n\n- **Underground electrical ducts** (C77–C80):  \n  - Three-conductor cables in underground ducts (one cable per duct).  \n  - Single-conductor cables in ducts (three conductors per duct).  \n\n- **Directly buried cables** (C81–C86):  \n  - Single-conductor and three-conductor cables buried directly in earth.  \n  - Triplexed single-conductor cables buried directly.  \n\n#### **Key Features Unique to CEC:**\n- **Temperature correction factors** (40°C ambient default, with adjustments for other temperatures).  \n- **Shield grounding considerations** (e.g., single-point vs. multi-point grounding affects ampacity).  \n- **Burial depth adjustments** (6% derating per 300 mm depth increase).  \n\n---\n\n### **2. CEC 392.80: Ampacity Adjustments for Medium Voltage Cables in Cable Trays**\nThis section provides **installation-specific derating rules** for medium voltage cables in cable trays, including:  \n- **Multiconductor cables**: Tables 311.60(C)(75) and (C)(76) with adjustments for tray coverage (e.g., 95% reduction for fully covered trays).  \n- **Single-conductor cables**: Tables 311.60(C)(69)–(C)(72) with derating for spacing and configuration (e.g., 75% reduction for covered trays).  \n\n---\n\n### **3. CEC 392.22(A)–(B): Cable Tray Fill Requirements**\nThese tables specify **maximum allowable fill areas** for medium voltage cables in different tray types (ladder, ventilated, solid bottom) based on conductor size and configuration. For example:  \n- **Table 392.22(A)**: Fill limits for multiconductor cables trays (4/0 AWG and larger vs. smaller cables).  \n- **Table 392.22(B)**: Fill limits for single-conductor cable trays (1000 kcmil and larger vs. smaller cables).  \n\n---\n\n### **Comparison with NEC**\nThe **NEC 2023** does not include equivalent tables for medium voltage cables in these specific configurations. California’s CEC adds these requirements to address local installation practices and environmental conditions (e.g., high ambient temperatures, unique cable tray designs).  \n\n---\n\n**Sources:**  \n✓ CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (reference)",

Temperature correction factors from Table 310.15(B)(1) would apply if the ambient temperature differs.  \n\n**Exceptions Checked:**  \n1. **Temperature Corrections**: If ambient temperature ≠ 30°C, apply correction factors from Table 310.15(B)(1).  \n2. **Adjustment for >3 Conductors**: Not applicable here (Column B assumes ≤3 conductors).  \n3. **Installation Restrictions**: Flexible cords cannot substitute fixed wiring (400.12), but this does not affect ampacity calculations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo exceptions override the base ampacity of **37A** for 12 AWG Column B flexible cord under standard conditions.  \n\n---\n\n## NEC 2023 Reference  \nNo difference from NEC 2023.

Branch Circuit Requirements**\n- **CEC 625.40 + 625.47**:  \n  - **Default**: Individual branch circuit per EV outlet.  \n  - **Exception**: Multiple circuits allowed for **bidirectional systems** or **power export equipment** (e.g., vehicle-to-grid systems).  \n- **NEC 210.11(C)(4)**:  \n  - Requires a **20A, 120V circuit** for garage receptacles (including EVs), but allows shared circuits for other garage loads.  \n\n#### **2. Power Export Systems**\n- **CEC 625.48**:  \n  - Mandates **listing and marking** for bidirectional EVSE. Requires compliance with **UL 1741** or **UL 9741** for interactive systems.  \n  - **No NEC Equivalent**: NEC references optional standby systems (Article 702) but lacks specific EVSE bidirectional provisions.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Determination**\n- **CEC is stricter** on default branch circuit requirements (625.40) but provides flexibility for advanced systems via exceptions (625.47).  \n- **NEC allows shared circuits** in garages (210.11(C)(4)) but lacks detailed requirements for bidirectional EVSE.  \n\n✓ **Sources: CEC 2022 (primary), NEC 2023 (comparison)**",
