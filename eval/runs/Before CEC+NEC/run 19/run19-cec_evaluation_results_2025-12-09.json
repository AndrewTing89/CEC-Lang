      "answer": "## Electric Cooktop Readiness in New California Homes (CEC 2022 vs NEC 2023)\n\n### **CEC 2022 Requirements**  \nPer **CEC 2022 Section 422.3**:  \n- **Single-family homes**: Must include **dedicated circuits** and circuit identifications for electric cooktops (California Energy Code Section 150.0(u)).  \n- **Multifamily homes**: Must comply with **California Energy Code Section 160.9(b)**, requiring dedicated circuits for electric cooktops.  \n- **Exceptions**:  \n  - **422.33**: Allows cord-and-plug-connected appliances to use accessible separable connectors or receptacles as disconnecting means.  \n  - **422.23**: Non-standard installation methods require special permission but do not override readiness mandates.  \n\n### **NEC 2023 Comparison**  \nThe **National Electrical Code (NEC 2023)** does **not** mandate \"readiness\" provisions for electric cooktops. Key differences:  \n1. **No Dedicated Circuit Mandates**:  \n   - NEC focuses on electrical safety (e.g., Article 422 for appliances) and load calculations (NEC 220.55 for cooking appliances).  \n   - Example: NEC 422.10 requires branch circuits to match appliance ratings but does not require pre-wiring for future cooktops.  \n\n2. **Load Calculations**:  \n   - NEC 220.55 uses demand factors to size service/feeder conductors for cooking appliances but does not address infrastructure readiness.  \n\n3. **Disconnecting Means**:  \n   - NEC 422.30 requires disconnecting means for appliances but does not specify pre-wiring for cooktops.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaway**  \nCalifornia’s CEC explicitly requires **pre-wiring for electric cooktops** in new homes to support electrification goals, while NEC 2023 remains neutral on appliance readiness. Exceptions in CEC (e.g., 422.33) provide installation flexibility but do not eliminate the core readiness provisions. This reflects California’s proactive approach to decarbonization versus NEC’s focus on electrical safety.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

This reflects California's amendments to prioritize copper in critical control circuits, while NEC allows aluminum where applicable.

California restricts aluminum use for small conductors (≤10 AWG) compared to NEC. Always verify conductor material and installation type (in-enclosure vs. extended) to select the correct column (A/B/C). Exceptions allow alternative protection methods for critical systems like fire pumps.\n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

These include:\n- **Tables 311.60(C)(67) through 311.60(C)(86)**  \n  Provide ampacities for MV cables in various configurations (e.g., triplexed in air, direct burial, underground ducts).\n\n**Key CEC Provisions:**\n- **311.60(C):** Specifies ampacities for copper and aluminum conductors in 20+ configurations.\n- **311.60(D):** Ambient temperature correction factors (e.g., 40°C baseline).\n- **Exceptions:** Allow higher ampacity for short circuit segments (≤10 ft or 10% of total length).\n\n---\n\n### NEC 2023 Comparison\nThe NEC **does not include equivalent tables** for medium voltage cables. Instead, it references:\n- **NEC 310.15(B)(3)(a):** General ambient temperature correction factors.\n- **NEC 310.15(C)(1):** Bundling derating factors for conductors.\n- **NEC 311.10:** Limited to definitions and general installation rules for MV cables.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n- **CEC is more restrictive** by providing **dedicated MV ampacity tables** (311.60 series) not found in NEC.\n- NEC relies on **general adjustment factors** (temperature, bundling) without MV-specific tables.\n- CEC tables account for **installation-specific scenarios** (e.g., cable trays, burial depth), while NEC uses broad adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Why CEC Has Unique MV Tables\nCalifornia mandates detailed MV ampacity rules due to:\n1. **Title 24 Energy Efficiency Standards:** Requires precise load calculations.\n2. **CALGreen Code:** Emphasizes electrical system efficiency and safety.\n3. **High-Density Urban Installations:** Demands specific derating for cable trays.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- **CEC Tables:** 311.60(C)(67)–311.60(C)(86) (18 tables for MV ampacities).\n- **NEC:** No equivalent tables; uses general adjustment rules.\n- **Restrictiveness:** CEC is **more restrictive** by providing detailed MV-specific requirements.\n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

These exceptions modify ampacity requirements for specific applications but do **not affect general conductor ampacity** in this case.  \n   - Exception No. 1: Allows use of \"branch-circuit selection current\" for hermetic compressors.  \n   - Exception No. 2: Applies to cord-and-plug-connected equipment (see 440.22(B)).  \n\n2. **Cross-References to Check:**  \n   - **Section 310.15(B):** Ambient temperature correction factors (if ambient ≠ 30°C).  \n   - **Section 240.4(D):** Overcurrent protection limitations (e.g., 4/0 AWG copper must be protected at ≤ 250A unless exceptions apply).  \n\n**Comparison with NEC 2023:**  \n- NEC Table 310.16 also specifies **230A** for 4/0 AWG copper at 75°C.  \n- No California amendments modify this value.  \n\n**Final Notes:**  \n- The 230A value applies under standard conditions (≤3 conductors, 30°C ambient).  \n- Adjustments for temperature, bundling, or overcurrent protection must follow CEC 310.15 and 240.4(D).  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 and NEC 2023 Table 310.16",

Where no rated-load current is shown on the equipment nameplate, the rated-load current shown on the compressor nameplate shall be used.\n\n\nException No. 1: Where so marked, the branch-circuit selection current shall be used instead of the rated-load current to determine the rating or ampacity of the disconnecting means, the branch-circuit conductors, the controller, and the branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protection.\n\nException  No.  2: For cord-and-plug-connected equipment, the nameplate marking shall be used in accordance with 440.22(B), Exception No. 2.\n\n##### (B) Multimotor Equipment. For multimotor equipment employing a shaded-pole or permanent split-capacitor-type fan or blower motor, the full-load current for such motor marked on the nameplate of the equipment in which the fan or blower motor is employed shall be used instead of the horsepower rating to determine the ampacity or rating of the disconnecting means, the branch-circuit conductors, the controller, the branchcircuit short-circuit and ground-fault protection, and the separate overload protection. This marking on the equipment nameplate shall not be less than the current marked on the fan or blower motor nameplate.\n",

The conductors to the hoistway door interlocks from the hoistway riser shall be one of the following:\n- (1) Flame retardant and suitable for a temperature of not less than 200°C (392°F). Conductors shall be Type SF or equivalent.\n- (2)  Physically protected using an approved method, such that the conductor assembly is flame retardant and suitable for a temperature of not less than 200°C (392°F).\n(B)  Traveling Cables. Traveling cables used as flexible connections between the elevator or dumbwaiter car or counterweight and the raceway shall be of the types of elevator cable listed in Table 400.4 or other approved types.\n(C)  Other  Wiring. All  conductors  in  raceways  shall  have flame-retardant insulation.\nConductors  shall  be  Type  MTW,  TF,  TFF,  TFN,  TFFN, THHN, THW, THWN, TW, XHHW, hoistway cable, or any other conductor with insulation designated as flame retardant.\nShielded conductors shall be permitted if such conductors are insulated for the maximum nominal circuit voltage applied to any conductor within the cable or raceway system.\n(D)  Insulation. All conductors shall have an insulation voltage rating  equal  to  at  least  the  maximum  nominal  circuit  voltage applied  to  any  conductor  within  the  enclosure,  cable,  or  raceway. Insulations and outer coverings that are marked for limited smoke and are so listed shall be permitted.\n",

This reflects California-specific amendments to accommodate specialized applications requiring higher temperature tolerance.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Table 402.3; NEC 2023 Table 402.3 comparison.",

      "answer": "## CEC 2022 vs NEC 2023 Comparison for Ampacity Adjustments\n\n### **1. Base Ampacity (Table 310.16)**\n- **CEC 2022**: 8 AWG THWN copper = **50A** (75°C column)  \n- **NEC 2023**: 8 AWG THWN copper = **50A** (75°C column)  \n  ➔ **Identical values** for base ampacity.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Temperature Correction (40°C Ambient)**\n- **CEC 2022**:  \n  Factor = **0.88** (Table 310.15(B)(1))  \n  *Based on 30°C ambient baseline.*  \n\n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  Factor = **0.88** (Table 310.15(B)(1))  \n  *Same correction factor applied.*  \n\n**Key Difference**:  \n- **NEC** allows an **equation-based** temperature correction (Section 315.60(A)(4)):  \n  $$\n  I' = I \\sqrt{\\frac{T_c - T_a'}{T_c - T_a}}\n  $$  \n  *Not used in this case since the table factor matches.*  \n- **CEC** uses **fixed table factors** (no equation-based adjustments).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Bundling Adjustment (7 Conductors)**\n- **CEC 2022**:  \n  Factor = **0.70** (Table 310.15(C)(1))  \n\n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  Factor = **0.70** (Table 310.15(C)(1))  \n\n**Key Difference**:  \n- **NEC** excludes **grounding/bonding conductors** from the count (Section 310.15(C)(1)(f)).  \n- **CEC** includes all conductors unless explicitly excluded (Section 310.15(C)(1)).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Termination Temperature Limitations**\n- **CEC 2022**:  \n  Requires corrected/adjusted ampacity **not to exceed termination ratings** (Section 310.15, referencing 110.14(C)).  \n  *THWN is 75°C-rated; terminations must be ≥75°C.*  \n\n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  Same requirement (Section 110.14(C)):  \n  *Adjusted ampacity must not exceed the lowest temperature rating of conductors or terminations.*  \n\n**Practical Impact**:  \n- Both codes require verification of termination ratings.  \n- **CEC** explicitly marks this as a California amendment (delta symbol).  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Special Scenarios**\n- **Rooftop Installations**:  \n  - **CEC**: No specific adder for rooftop temperatures.  \n  - **NEC**: Requires **+33°C** adder for raceways/cables on rooftops (Section 310.15(B)(2)).  \n  *Not applicable here but critical for similar scenarios.*  \n\n- **Flexible Cords**:  \n  - **CEiling fans** and **EV charging** have unique rules in CEC (e.g., Section 400.5, 625.51).  \n  - **NEC** uses general Table 400.5 for flexible cords.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Adjusted Ampacity**\n- **CEC 2022**: 50A × 0.88 × 0.70 = **30.8A**  \n- **NEC 2023**: 50A × 0.88 × 0.70 = **30.8A**  \n\n**Conclusion**:  \n- **Same result** for this scenario, but **CEC has stricter amendments** in special cases (e.g., rooftop installations, termination verification).  \n- Always verify **termination temperatures** in CEC (110.14(C)) and consider **California-specific amendments** marked with [∆].  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 / NEC 2023 Tables 310.16, 310.15(B)(1), 310.15(C)(1)",

Base Ampacity (Table 310.16)**\n- **CEC 2022**: 8 AWG THWN copper = **50A** (75°C column)  \n- **NEC 2023**: 8 AWG THWN copper = **50A** (75°C column)  \n  ➔ **Identical values** for base ampacity.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Temperature Correction (40°C Ambient)**\n- **CEC 2022**:  \n  Factor = **0.88** (Table 310.15(B)(1))  \n  *Based on 30°C ambient baseline.*  \n\n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  Factor = **0.88** (Table 310.15(B)(1))  \n  *Same correction factor applied.*  \n\n**Key Difference**:  \n- **NEC** allows an **equation-based** temperature correction (Section 315.60(A)(4)):  \n  $$\n  I' = I \\sqrt{\\frac{T_c - T_a'}{T_c - T_a}}\n  $$  \n  *Not used in this case since the table factor matches.*  \n- **CEC** uses **fixed table factors** (no equation-based adjustments).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Bundling Adjustment (7 Conductors)**\n- **CEC 2022**:  \n  Factor = **0.70** (Table 310.15(C)(1))  \n\n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  Factor = **0.70** (Table 310.15(C)(1))  \n\n**Key Difference**:  \n- **NEC** excludes **grounding/bonding conductors** from the count (Section 310.15(C)(1)(f)).  \n- **CEC** includes all conductors unless explicitly excluded (Section 310.15(C)(1)).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Termination Temperature Limitations**\n- **CEC 2022**:  \n  Requires corrected/adjusted ampacity **not to exceed termination ratings** (Section 310.15, referencing 110.14(C)).  \n  *THWN is 75°C-rated; terminations must be ≥75°C.*  \n\n- **NEC 2023**:  \n  Same requirement (Section 110.14(C)):  \n  *Adjusted ampacity must not exceed the lowest temperature rating of conductors or terminations.*  \n\n**Practical Impact**:  \n- Both codes require verification of termination ratings.  \n- **CEC** explicitly marks this as a California amendment (delta symbol).  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Special Scenarios**\n- **Rooftop Installations**:  \n  - **CEC**: No specific adder for rooftop temperatures.  \n  - **NEC**: Requires **+33°C** adder for raceways/cables on rooftops (Section 310.15(B)(2)).  \n  *Not applicable here but critical for similar scenarios.*  \n\n- **Flexible Cords**:  \n  - **CEiling fans** and **EV charging** have unique rules in CEC (e.g., Section 400.5, 625.51).  \n  - **NEC** uses general Table 400.5 for flexible cords.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Adjusted Ampacity**\n- **CEC 2022**: 50A × 0.88 × 0.70 = **30.8A**  \n- **NEC 2023**: 50A × 0.88 × 0.70 = **30.8A**  \n\n**Conclusion**:  \n- **Same result** for this scenario, but **CEC has stricter amendments** in special cases (e.g., rooftop installations, termination verification).  \n- Always verify **termination temperatures** in CEC (110.14(C)) and consider **California-specific amendments** marked with [∆].  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 / NEC 2023 Tables 310.16, 310.15(B)(1), 310.15(C)(1)",

      "status": "PASS",
      "answer": "## Final Answer: Panelboard Space Requirements (CEC 2022 vs NEC 2023)\n\n### **California Electrical Code (CEC 2022)**\n- **Reserved Circuit Breaker Spaces** (Section 408.2(A)):\n  - **Mandatory** for single-family dwellings: Panelboards must include dedicated spaces for:\n    - Heat pump water heaters\n    - Heat pump space heaters\n    - Electric cooktops\n    - Electric clothes dryers\n  - **Exceptions Checked**: No exceptions override this requirement. Related exceptions (e.g., 408.38 for enclosures, 408.55 for wire-bending space) do not relax the reserved space mandate in 408.2(A).\n\n### **National Electrical Code (NEC 2023)**\n- **No Specific Requirements** for reserved spaces in single-family dwellings.\n  - General panelboard rules apply (e.g., 408.30 for minimum rating), but **no appliance-specific space mandates**.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences**\n| **Aspect**                | **CEC 2022**                                                                 | **NEC 2023**                          |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Reserved Spaces**       | Requires 4 dedicated spaces for appliances (Section 408.2(A)).              | No appliance-specific space mandates. |\n| **Scope**                 | Applies to single-family residential buildings.                             | Applies universally without CA amendments. |\n| **Restrictiveness**       | **More restrictive** due to California Energy Code mandates.              | **Less restrictive** (no appliance-specific rules). |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nCEC 2022 is **more restrictive** than NEC 2023 for single-family dwellings by requiring **dedicated panelboard spaces** for energy-efficient appliances. This ensures compliance with California’s electrification goals. NEC 2023 lacks these specific requirements, making it more permissive. Exceptions in CEC (e.g., for enclosures or wire-bending space) do not override the reserved space mandate in 408.2(A).\n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022 Section 408.2(A) and NEC 2023 Article 408.",

However, exceptions in **625.47** and **625.48** provide flexibility for interactive/bidirectional systems and multi-circuit installations with listed equipment. NEC 2023 lacks these specific exceptions, making CEC more restrictive in most scenarios but allowing targeted deviations for advanced systems.  \n\n✓ **Source**: CEC 2022 Sections 625.40, 625.47, 625.48; NEC 2023 Article 625.",

      "answer": "## AFCI Protection Requirements Comparison (CEC 2022 vs NEC 2023) – **With Exceptions**\n\n---\n\n### **Exceptions in CEC 2022 for 210.12(A) (Dwelling Units)**\n\n1. **Receptacle Replacements (CEC 406.4(D)(4))**  \n   - **Requirement**: When replacing receptacles in AFCI-protected areas (per 210.12(A)), the replacement must be:  \n     - A listed outlet branch-circuit type AFCI receptacle, or  \n     - A receptacle protected by a listed outlet branch-circuit type AFCI receptacle, or  \n     - A receptacle protected by a listed combination-type AFCI circuit breaker.  \n   - **Exception**: Section 210.12(D) Exception **does not apply** to receptacle replacements.  \n   - **Implication**: California mandates **strict compliance** for AFCI-protected receptacle replacements, with no exceptions for short extensions (unlike 210.12(D)).  \n\n2. **Marking Requirements**  \n   - Receptacles protected by AFCI circuit breakers must be marked \"GFCI Protected\" and \"No Equipment Ground\" if no grounding conductor is present.  \n   - This aligns with NEC 406.4(D)(2)(c) but emphasizes **visible markings** post-installation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Updated Comparison Table**\n\n| **Aspect**                | **CEC 2022**                                                                 | **NEC 2023**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Receptacle Replacements** | **Must use AFCI-protected devices** (406.4(D)(4)).<br>- No exceptions for short extensions. | Permits replacement with non-AFCI receptacles if protected by upstream AFCI (404.22(C)(4)).<br>- Exceptions allowed for short extensions. |\n| **Marking Requirements**   | Mandatory \"GFCI Protected\" and \"No Equipment Ground\" markings for non-grounded receptacles. | Similar requirements but less explicit in marking for AFCI-protected receptacles. |\n| **Scope of Protection**    | Explicitly includes **hallways**, **laundry areas**, and **recreation rooms**. | Focuses on kitchens, family rooms, dining rooms, etc., with \"similar rooms\" as general guidance. |\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways from Exceptions**\n1. **Stricter Receptacle Replacement Rules**:  \n   - CEC **prohibits exceptions** for short extensions when replacing receptacles in AFCI-protected areas (unlike NEC 210.12(D)).  \n   - NEC allows a 6 ft (1.8 m) exception for extensions without new outlets, but CEC does not.  \n\n2. **Compliance Emphasis**:  \n   - California mandates **visible markings** (\"GFCI Protected\") for AFCI-protected receptacles, ensuring end-users recognize the protection.  \n\n3. **Code Citations**:  \n   - **CEC**: 210.12(A), 406.4(D)(4)  \n   - **NEC**: 210.12(A), 404.22(C)(4)  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nCEC 2022 imposes **more restrictive requirements** for AFCI protection in dwelling units, particularly for **receptacle replacements** and **marking visibility**. While NEC allows flexibility for short extensions and upstream AFCI protection, CEC mandates direct AFCI-protected devices for all replacements in specified areas. Always verify local amendments, as California may adopt additional amendments beyond the base CEC.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

Scope of Protection**\n| **Requirement** | **CEC 2022** | **NEC 2023** |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Applicable Circuits** | All 120V, single-phase, 15-20A branch circuits in: <br> - Kitchens <br> - Family rooms <br> - Dining rooms <br> - Living rooms <br> - Bedrooms <br> - Sunrooms <br> - Recreation rooms <br> - Hallways <br> - Laundry areas | All 120V, single-phase, 15-20A branch circuits in: <br> - Kitchens <br> - Family rooms <br> - Dining rooms <br> - Living rooms <br> - Parlors <br> - Libraries (NEC 210.11(B)) |\n| **Exceptions** | - Fire alarm systems (760.41(B)/760.121(B)) <br> - Branch circuit extensions ≤ 1.8m (6 ft) without new outlets | - Fire alarm systems (760.41(B)/760.121(B)) <br> - Replaced receptacles in specified areas must use AFCI-protected devices (404.22(C)(4)) |\n\n---\n\n### **2. Installation Methods**\n| **Method** | **CEC 2022** | **NEC 2023** |\n|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Combination-Type AFCI** | Required for full branch circuit protection | Required for full branch circuit protection |\n| **Branch/Feeder-Type AFCI + Outlet AFCI** | Permitted with specific marking at first outlet | Permitted with specific marking at first outlet |\n| **Supplemental Arc Protection + Outlet AFCI** | Permitted if: <br> - Wiring is continuous <br> - Conductor length ≤ 15.2m (50 ft) for 14 AWG <br> - First outlet marked | Not explicitly permitted |\n| **Concrete-Encased Circuits** | Permitted to install outlet AFCI at first outlet | No explicit provision |\n| **Metal Raceway Circuits** | Permitted to install outlet AFCI at first outlet | Permitted under similar conditions (210.12(A)(5)) |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Differences**\n1. **Additional Locations in CEC**:\n   - CEC explicitly includes **hallways**, **laundry areas**, and **recreation rooms** in AFCI requirements, while NEC focuses on \"similar rooms\" without explicit examples.\n\n2. **Installation Flexibility**:\n   - CEC allows **supplemental arc protection circuit breakers** combined with outlet AFCIs under strict length limits (15.2m for 14 AWG), which NEC does not explicitly permit.\n\n3. **Concrete/Encased Circuits**:\n   - CEC permits outlet AFCI installation at first outlet for circuits encased in ≥50mm (2 in.) concrete, while NEC does not address this scenario directly.\n\n4. **Receptacle Replacements**:\n   - NEC requires replaced receptacles in AFCI-protected areas to use **listed outlet AFCI receptacles** or be protected by a combination AFCI (404.22(C)(4)). CEC lacks this specific requirement.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Code Citations**\n- **CEC 2022**: Section 210.12(A), 210.12(A)(3), 210.12(A)(6)  \n- **NEC 2023**: Section 210.12(A), 210.11(B), 404.22(C)(4)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nCEC 2022 expands AFCI coverage to additional dwelling areas (e.g., hallways, laundry rooms) and provides more installation options (e.g., supplemental arc protection). NEC 2023 focuses on standardized locations and adds specific requirements for receptacle replacements. Both codes prioritize combination-type AFCIs but differ in flexibility for alternative methods. Always verify local amendments, as California may adopt stricter requirements. \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

While NEC allows flexibility for short extensions and upstream AFCI protection, CEC mandates direct AFCI-protected devices for all replacements in specified areas. Always verify local amendments, as California may adopt additional amendments beyond the base CEC.  \n\n✓ Source: CEC 2022, NEC 2023",

Where not part of a listed assembly, or where not otherwise covered in this Code, multiconductor jacketed cables, including DG cable, shall be installed in accordance with the product listing and shall be permitted in PV systems. These cables shall be installed in accordance with the following:\n- (1)  In raceways, where on or in buildings other than rooftops\n- (2)  Where not in raceways, in accordance with the following:\n- a.  Marked sunlight resistant in exposed outdoor locations\n- b.  Protected or guarded, where subject to physical damage\n- c.  Closely follow the surface of support structures\n- d.  Secured at intervals not exceeding 1.8 m (6 ft)\n- e.  Secured within 600 mm (24 in.) of mating connectors or entering enclosures\n- f.  Marked direct burial, where buried in the earth\n(4)  Flexible  Cords  and  Cables  Connected  to  Tracking PV Arrays. Flexible  cords  and  flexible  cables,  where  connected  to  moving  parts  of  tracking  PV  arrays,  shall  comply with Article  400  and  shall  be  of  a  type  identified  as  a  hard service cord or portable power cable; they shall be suitable for extra-hard usage, listed  for  outdoor  use,  water  resistant,  and sunlight resistant. Allowable ampacities shall be in accordance with  400.5.  Stranded  copper  PV  wire  shall  be  permitted  to be connected to moving parts of tracking PV arrays in accordance with the minimum number of strands specified in Table 690.31(C)(4).\n- (5)  Flexible, Fine-Stranded Cables. Flexible, fine-stranded cables shall be terminated only with terminals, lugs, devices, or connectors in accordance with 110.14. N\n(6)  Small-Conductor  Cables. Single-conductor  cables  listed for outdoor use that are sunlight resistant and moisture resistant in sizes 16 AWG and 18 AWG shall be permitted for module interconnections where such cables meet the ampacity requirements\nTable 690.31(C)(4)  Minimum PV Wire Strands\nof  400.5.  Section  310.14  shall  be  used  to  determine  the  cable ampacity adjustment and correction factors.\n- (D)  Direct-Current  Circuits  on  or  in  Buildings. Where inside buildings, PV system dc circuits that exceed 30 volts or 8 amperes shall be contained in metal raceways, in Type MC metal-clad cable that complies with 250.118(10), or in metal enclosures. ∆\nException:  PV hazard control systems installed in accordance with  690.12(B)(2)(1)  shall  be  permitted  to  be  provided  with or  listed  for  use  with  nonmetallic  enclosure(s),  nonmetallic raceway(s), and cables other than Type MC metal-clad cable(s), at the point of penetration of the surface of the building to the PV hazard control actuator.\nWiring methods on or in buildings shall comply with the additional installation requirements in 690.31(D)(1) and (D)(2).\n(1)  Flexible  Wiring  Methods. Where  flexible metal conduit (FMC) smaller than metric designator 21 (trade size  3 /4) or Type MC cable smaller than 25 mm (1 in.) in diameter containing PV power circuit conductors is installed across ceilings or floor joists, the raceway or cable shall be protected by substantial guard strips that are at least as high as the raceway or cable. Where run exposed, other than within 1.8 m (6 ft) of their connection to equipment, these wiring methods shall closely follow the building surface or be protected from physical damage by an approved means.\n- (2)  Marking  and  Labeling  Required. Unless  located  and arranged so the purpose is evident, the following wiring methods and enclosures that contain PV system dc circuit conductors shall be marked with the wording PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER SOURCE or SOLAR PV DC CIRCUIT by means of permanently affixed labels or other approved permanent marking: ∆\n- (1)  Exposed raceways, cable trays, and other wiring methods\n- (2)  Covers or enclosures of pull boxes and junction boxes\n- (3)  Conduit bodies in which any of the available conduit openings are unused\nThe  labels  or  markings  shall  be  visible  after  installation. All letters  shall  be  capitalized  and  shall  be  a  minimum  height of 9.5 mm ( 3 /8 in.) in white on a red background. Labels shall appear on every section of the wiring system that is separated by enclosures, walls, partitions, ceilings, or floors. Spacing between labels or markings, or between a label and a marking, shall not\n•\nbe more than 3 m (10 ft). Labels required by this section shall be suitable for the environment where they are installed.\n- (E)  Bipolar  Photovoltaic  Systems. Where  the  sum,  without consideration  of  polarity,  of  the  voltages  of  the  two  monopole circuits exceeds the rating of the conductors and connected equipment, monopole circuits in a bipolar PV system shall be physically separated, and the electrical output circuits from each monopole circuit shall be installed in separate raceways until connected to the  inverter.  The  disconnecting  means  and  overcurrent  protective devices for each monopole circuit output shall be in separate enclosures. All conductors from each separate monopole circuit shall  be  routed  in  the  same  raceway.  Solidly  grounded  bipolar PV systems shall  be  clearly  marked  with  a  permanent,  legible warning notice indicating that the disconnection of the grounded conductor(s) may result in overvoltage on the equipment. ·\nException:  Listed switchgear rated for the maximum voltage between circuits  and  containing  a  physical  barrier  separating the disconnecting means for each monopole circuit shall be permitted to be used instead of disconnecting means in separate enclosures.\n- (F)  Wiring Methods and Mounting Systems. Roof-mounted PV array mounting systems shall be permitted to be held in place with an approved means other than those required by 110.13 and shall utilize wiring methods that allow any expected movement of the array. N\nInformational Note:  Expected movement of unattached PV arrays is often included in structural calculations.\n",
