### cec2022-027
**Question:** A conduit in an attic contains six 12 AWG TW (60°C rated) copper conductors at 110°F (43°C). Calculate the adjusted ampacity.

**Agent Answer:** Base: 20A. Temperature correction: 0.82. Bundling: 0.80. Adjusted: 20A × 0.82 × 0.80 = 13.12A

**Expected Answer:** Base: 20A. Temperature correction: 0.71 (for 41-45°C in 60°C column). Bundling: 0.80. Adjusted: 20A × 0.71 × 0.80 = 11.36A

**Score:** 6/10 (Accuracy: 2/5, Completeness: 4/5)
**Accuracy Notes:** Agent used wrong temperature correction factor. For 60°C conductors at 43°C, the factor should be 0.71 (from 60°C column), not 0.82 (which is for 75°C conductors). This results in wrong final answer of 13.12A vs correct 11.36A.
