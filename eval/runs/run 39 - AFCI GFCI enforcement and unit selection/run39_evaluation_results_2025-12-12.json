      "answer": "## Aluminum Conductors for 200A Service (CEC 2022)\n\n**Answer:**  \nYes, aluminum conductors can be used for a 200A service. The required size is **350 kcmil aluminum**.\n\n**Details:**  \n1. **Minimum Size Requirement**:  \n   - Section 230.31(B) specifies the minimum size for service conductors. For aluminum, the minimum is **6 AWG**, but this applies to smaller services. For 200A, larger sizes are required.  \n\n2. **Ampacity Determination**:  \n   - Using **Table 310.16** (ampacity table) for aluminum conductors at 75°C (per 110.14(C) termination limits):  \n     - **350 kcmil aluminum** has an ampacity of **200A**, which matches the 200A service requirement.  \n\n3. **Code References**:  \n   - **Section 230.42(A)(1)**: Service conductors must have an ampacity of at least the maximum load. For continuous loads, 125% of the load is required, but the service rating already accounts for this.  \n   - **Table 310.16**: Confirms 350 kcmil aluminum at 75°C provides 200A ampacity.  \n\n**Inspector Note:**  \n- Ensure the installation environment does not require additional adjustments (e.g., temperature corrections or bundling factors). If adjustments apply, a larger size may be necessary.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

The required size is **350 kcmil aluminum**.\n\n**Details:**  \n1. **Minimum Size Requirement**:  \n   - Section 230.31(B) specifies the minimum size for service conductors. For aluminum, the minimum is **6 AWG**, but this applies to smaller services. For 200A, larger sizes are required.  \n\n2. **Ampacity Determination**:  \n   - Using **Table 310.16** (ampacity table) for aluminum conductors at 75°C (per 110.14(C) termination limits):  \n     - **350 kcmil aluminum** has an ampacity of **200A**, which matches the 200A service requirement.  \n\n3. **Code References**:  \n   - **Section 230.42(A)(1)**: Service conductors must have an ampacity of at least the maximum load. For continuous loads, 125% of the load is required, but the service rating already accounts for this.  \n   - **Table 310.16**: Confirms 350 kcmil aluminum at 75°C provides 200A ampacity.  \n\n**Inspector Note:**  \n- Ensure the installation environment does not require additional adjustments (e.g., temperature corrections or bundling factors).

This ensures both ungrounded conductors are disconnected together, preventing neutral overloading.\n\n2. **Breaker Rating**  \n   - **Section 240.4(D)**: For 12 AWG copper conductors (12/3 cable), the maximum overcurrent protection is **20A**. A 20A breaker is required.\n\n---\n\n### Neutral Conductor Requirements\n1. **Sizing**  \n   - **Section 210.4(D)**: The neutral conductor must be sized to carry the **maximum unbalanced load**. For 12/3 cable, the neutral is **12 AWG**, matching the ungrounded conductors.\n\n2. **Termination**  \n   - **Section 200.4(B)**: The neutral must be terminated **in the same panel** as the breakers and connected to the **neutral bus**.  \n   - **Section 210.4(D)**: The neutral must **not be shared** with other circuits unless explicitly permitted (not applicable here).\n\n3. **Prohibited Uses**  \n   - **Section 210.4(C)**: The neutral must **only serve line-to-neutral loads** (e.g., receptacles). It cannot supply line-to-line loads (e.g., 240V appliances).\n\n---\n\n### Key Exceptions\n- **Exception 210.4(C) Ex. 1**: If the circuit serves only one utilization equipment (e.g., a single appliance), the neutral can carry harmonic currents.  \n- **Exception 210.4(C) Ex. 2**: If all ungrounded conductors are opened simultaneously (e.g., via a 2-pole breaker), the neutral can serve line-to-line loads. Not applicable here for standard kitchen receptacles.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- **Breaker**: Two 20A single-pole breakers with **handle ties** (Section 240.15(B)(1)).  \n- **Neutral**: 12 AWG, terminated to the **neutral bus** in the panel (Section 200.4(B)).  \n- **Loads**: Only line-to-neutral (120V) receptacles allowed (Section 210.4(C)).  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

This ensures both ungrounded conductors are disconnected together, preventing neutral overloading.\n\n2. **Breaker Rating**  \n   - **Section 240.4(D)**: For 12 AWG copper conductors (12/3 cable), the maximum overcurrent protection is **20A**. A 20A breaker is required.\n\n---\n\n### Neutral Conductor Requirements\n1. **Sizing**  \n   - **Section 210.4(D)**: The neutral conductor must be sized to carry the **maximum unbalanced load**. For 12/3 cable, the neutral is **12 AWG**, matching the ungrounded conductors.\n\n2. **Termination**  \n   - **Section 200.4(B)**: The neutral must be terminated **in the same panel** as the breakers and connected to the **neutral bus**.  \n   - **Section 210.4(D)**: The neutral must **not be shared** with other circuits unless explicitly permitted (not applicable here).\n\n3. **Prohibited Uses**  \n   - **Section 210.4(C)**: The neutral must **only serve line-to-neutral loads** (e.g., receptacles). It cannot supply line-to-line loads (e.g., 240V appliances).\n\n---\n\n### Key Exceptions\n- **Exception 210.4(C) Ex. 1**: If the circuit serves only one utilization equipment (e.g., a single appliance), the neutral can carry harmonic currents.  \n- **Exception 210.4(C) Ex. 2**: If all ungrounded conductors are opened simultaneously (e.g., via a 2-pole breaker), the neutral can serve line-to-line loads. Not applicable here for standard kitchen receptacles.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- **Breaker**: Two 20A single-pole breakers with **handle ties** (Section 240.15(B)(1)).  \n- **Neutral**: 12 AWG, terminated to the **neutral bus** in the panel (Section 200.4(B)).  \n- **Loads**: Only line-to-neutral (120V) receptacles allowed (Section 210.4(C)).  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

      "answer": "## Medium Voltage Cable Tables in CEC 2022\n\nCalifornia's CEC 2022 includes specific tables for medium voltage (MV) cables (rated 2001V–35,000V) in **Section 311.60** and **Section 392.80(B)**. These tables govern ampacities and installation requirements for Type MV cables in cable trays. Below are the key tables and their applications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Ampacity Tables for Type MV Cables**\n**Location:** CEC 2022 Tables 311.60(C)(69)–311.60(C)(76)  \n**Application:** Used to determine ampacities for medium voltage cables installed in cable trays.  \n\n#### **Multiconductor Cables**  \n- **Table 311.60(C)(75)** and **Table 311.60(C)(76)**  \n  - For multiconductor MV cables in **uncovered** and **covered cable trays**, respectively.  \n  - Adjustments:  \n    - **Covered trays** (≥6 ft continuous cover): Allow 95% of tabulated ampacities.  \n    - **Single-layer spacing** (≥1× cable diameter): Use Table 311.60(C)(71)–(72).  \n\n#### **Single-Conductor Cables**  \n- **Table 311.60(C)(69)** and **Table 311.60(C)(70)**  \n  - For single-conductor MV cables in **uncovered** and **covered cable trays**, respectively.  \n  - Adjustments:  \n    - **Covered trays** (≥6 ft continuous cover): Allow 70% of tabulated ampacities for 1/0 AWG and larger.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Installation Requirements**  \n**Location:** CEC 2022 Section 392.80(B)  \n**Key Conditions:**  \n1. **Cable Tray Fill Limits:**  \n   - Follow **Section 392.22** for allowable fill percentages based on tray type (ladder, ventilated, solid bottom).  \n   - Example: Solid bottom trays with multiconductor MV cables must not exceed 40% fill depth (for trays ≤6 in. deep).  \n\n2. **Ampacity Adjustments:**  \n   - **Spacing Requirements:**  \n     - Single-layer installations require ≥1× cable diameter spacing between cables.  \n   - **Thermal Derates:**  \n     - Covered trays reduce ampacities by 5–30% depending on cable size and configuration (see Section 392.80(B)(1)–(2)).  \n\n---\n\n### **3. California-Specific Notes**  \n- **Type MV Cable Definition:** Per CEC 311.2, Type MV cables are solid dielectric insulated, rated 2001V–35,000V.  \n- **Termination Limits:** Ensure conductor temperature ratings (e.g., 75°C or 90°C) align with termination equipment per **Section 110.14(C)**.  \n- **Engineering Supervision:** For non-tabled scenarios, ampacities must be calculated under engineering supervision per **Section 311.60(A)**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Tables**  \n| **Table**                | **Application**                          | **Conditions**                          |  \n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|  \n| 311.60(C)(71)–(72)       | Multiconductor MV cables (spaced)        | Single-layer, uncovered trays            |  \n| 311.60(C)(75)–(76)       | Multiconductor MV cables (covered trays) | ≥6 ft continuous cover                   |  \n| 311.60(C)(69)–(70)       | Single-conductor MV cables                | 1/0 AWG+, covered/uncovered trays         |  \n\n---\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022  \n**Inspector Note:** Always verify cable tray type (ladder, ventilated, solid) and ambient conditions (temperature, coverage) when applying these tables.

      "answer": "## Maximum Overcurrent Protection for 16 AWG Copper Conductors in Motor Control Circuits (CEC 2022)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe maximum overcurrent protection for **16 AWG copper conductors** in a motor control circuit extending beyond the enclosure is **10 amperes**, as specified in **CEC 2022 Section 240.4(D)(2)**.  \n\n### Key Requirements from 240.4(D)(2):\n1. **Overcurrent Limit**: 10 amperes maximum.\n2. **Continuous Load Limit**: Continuous loads must not exceed **8 amperes**.\n3. **Permitted Overcurrent Devices**:\n   - Branch-circuit-rated circuit breakers listed for 16 AWG copper.\n   - Branch-circuit-rated fuses listed for 16 AWG copper.\n   - Class CC, Class J, or Class T fuses.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Motor Control Circuit Context**: While motor control circuits are referenced in **Table 240.4(G)** (pointing to Article 430), no exceptions override the 10A limit for 16 AWG copper in this scenario. The general rule in **240.4(D)(2)** governs unless specific exceptions in 430 apply (e.g., motor branch circuits), which are not triggered here.\n- **Extension Beyond Enclosure**: No additional restrictions are imposed by the CEC for conductors extending beyond the enclosure, provided the conductor size and overcurrent protection comply with 240.4(D)(2).\n\n**Inspector Note**: Verify that the conductors are not part of a branch circuit supplying multiple receptacles (which would require different rules) and that the overcurrent device is appropriately rated for 16 AWG copper.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Fixed multioutlet assemblies used in other than dwelling units or the guest rooms or guest suites of hotels or motels shall be calculated in accordance with (H)(1) or (H)(2). For the purposes of this section, the calculation shall be permitted to be based on the portion that contains receptacle outlets.\n\n\n- (1) Where appliances are unlikely to be used simultaneously, each 1.5 m (5 ft) or fraction thereof of each separate and continuous length shall be considered as one outlet of not less than 180 volt-amperes.\n\n- (2) Where appliances are likely to be used simultaneously, each 300 mm (1 ft) or fraction thereof shall be considered as an outlet of not less than 180 volt-amperes.\n\n\n##### (I) Receptacle Outlets. Except as covered in 220.14(J) and (K), receptacle outlets shall be calculated at not less than 180 voltamperes for each single or for each multiple receptacle on one yoke. A single piece of equipment consisting of a multiple receptacle comprised of four or more receptacles shall be calculated at not less than 90  volt-amperes per receptacle. This provision shall not be applicable to the receptacle outlets specified in 210.11(C)(1) and (C)(2).\n\n\n- ( J) Dwelling Units. In one-family, two-family, and multifamily dwellings, the minimum unit load shall be not less than 33  volt-amperes/m 2 (3 volt-amperes/ft 2 ). The lighting and receptacle outlets specified in 220.14( J)(1), ( J)(2), and ( J) (3) are included in the minimum unit load. No additional load ∆\n\ncalculations shall be required for such outlets. The minimum lighting load shall be determined using the minimum unit load and the floor area as determined in 220.11 for dwelling occupancies. Motors rated less than 1 /8 hp and connected to a lighting circuit shall be considered part of the minimum lighting load.\n\n- (1) All general-use receptacle outlets of 20-ampere rating or less, including receptacles connected to the circuits in 210.11(C) (3) and 210.11(C)(4)\n\n- (2) The receptacle outlets specified in 210.52(E) and (G)\n\n- (3) The lighting outlets specified in 210.70\n\n4. (K) Office Buildings. In office buildings, the receptacle loads shall be calculated to be the larger of (1) or (2): ∆\n- (1) The calculated load from 220.14(I) after all demand factors have been applied\n\n- (2) 11 volt-amperes/m 2 or 1 volt-ampere/ft 2\n\n\n##### (L) Other Outlets. Other outlets not covered in 220.14(A) through (K) shall be calculated based on 180 volt-amperes per outlet.\n\n\n##### (M) Hotel and Motel Occupancies. In guest rooms or guest suites of hotels and motels, the lighting and receptacle outlets specified in 220.14(M)(1), (M)(2), and (M)(3) are included in the minimum unit load in Table 220.12. No additional load calculations shall be required for such outlets. The minimum lighting load shall be determined using the minimum unit load and the floor area as determined in 220.11 for hotel and motel occupancies. N\n\n- (1) All general-use receptacle outlets of 20-ampere rating or less, including receptacles connected to the circuits in 210.11(C) (3) and 210.11(C)(4)\n\n- (2) The receptacle outlets specified in 210.52(E)(3)\n\n- (3) The lighting outlets specified in 210.70\n\nResult 5 [CEC 2022 Section 220.102] (relevance: 31.59)\n#### 220.102 Farm Loads - Buildings and Other Loads\n\n\n##### (A) Dwelling Unit. The feeder or service load of a farm dwelling unit shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions for dwellings in Part III or IV of this article. Where the dwelling has electric heat and the farm has electric grain-drying systems, Part IV of this article shall not be used to calculate the dwelling load where the dwelling and farm loads are supplied by a common service.\n\n\n##### (B) Other Than Dwelling Unit. Where a feeder or service supplies a farm building or other load having two or more separate branch circuits, the load for feeders, service conductors, and service equipment shall be calculated in accordance with demand factors not less than indicated in Table 220.102.\n\n\n============================================================\n[REFERENCED TABLE DATA - Use these exact values]\n============================================================\n### Table 220.12: General Lighting Loads by Non-Dwelling Occupancy\ntype_of_occupancy | volt_amperes_per_m2 | volt_amperes_per_ft2\n--- | --- | ---\nAutomotive facility | 16 | 1.5\nConvention center | 15 | 1.4\nCourthouse | 15 | 1.4\nDormitory | 16 | 1.5\nExercise center | 15 | 1.4\nFire station | 14 | 1.3\nGymnasium | 18 | 1.7\nHealth care clinic | 17 | 1.6\nHospital | 17 | 1.6\nHotels and motels, including a | 18 | 1.7\nLibrary | 16 | 1.5\nManufacturing facility | 24 | 2.2\nMotion picture theater | 17 | 1.6\nMuseum | 17 | 1.6\nOffice | 14 | 1.3\n\n**Footnotes:**\n  [general] The 125 percent multiplier for a continuous load as specified in 210.20(A) is included when using the unit loads in this table for calculating the minimum lighting load for a specified occupancy.\n  [a] Armories and auditoriums are considered gymnasium-type occupancies.\n  [b] Lodge rooms are similar to hotels and motels.\n  [c] Industrial commercial loft buildings are considered manufacturing-type occupancies.\n  [d] Banks are office-type occupancies.\n\n### Table 220.84: Optional Calculations — Demand Factors for Three or More Multifamily Dwelling Units\nrow_label | values\n--- | ---\n3–5 | Demand Factor (%): 45\n6–7 | Demand Factor (%): 44\n8–10 | Demand Factor (%): 43\n11 | Demand Factor (%): 42\n12–13 | Demand Factor (%): 41\n14–15 | Demand Factor (%): 40\n16–17 | Demand Factor (%): 39\n18–20 | Demand Factor (%): 38\n21 | Demand Factor (%): 37\n22–23 | Demand Factor (%): 36\n24–25 | Demand Factor (%): 35\n26–27 | Demand Factor (%): 34\n28–30 | Demand Factor (%): 33\n31 | Demand Factor (%): 32\n32–33 | Demand Factor (%): 31",
