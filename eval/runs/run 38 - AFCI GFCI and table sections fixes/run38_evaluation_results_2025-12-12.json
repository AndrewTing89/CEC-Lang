The calculated load shall be the result of adding the loads from 220.82(B) and (C). Feeder and serviceentrance conductors whose calculated load is determined by this optional calculation shall be permitted to have the neutral load determined by 220.61.\n\n\nTable 220.55 Demand Factors and Loads for Household Electric Ranges, Wall-Mounted Ovens, Counter-Mounted Cooking Units, and Other Household Cooking Appliances over 1 3 /4 kW Rating (Column C to be used in all cases except as otherwise permitted in Note 3.)\n\n\n## Notes:\n\n1. Over 12 kW through 27 kW ranges all of same rating. For ranges individually rated more than 12 kW but not more than 27 kW, the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each additional kilowatt of rating or major fraction thereof by which the rating of individual ranges exceeds 12 kW.\n\n2. Over 8 3 /4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 /4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.\n\n3. Over 1 3 /4 kW through 8 3 /4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 /4 kW but not more than 8 3 /4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.\n\n4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.\n\n5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 1 3 /4 kW and used in instructional programs.\n\nTable 220.56 Demand Factors for Kitchen Equipment - Other Than Dwelling Unit(s)\n\n\n##### (B) General Loads. The general calculated load shall be not less than 100 percent of the first 10 kV A plus 40 percent of the remainder of the following loads:\n\n\n- (1) 33 volt-amperes/m 2 or 3 volt-amperes/ft 2 for general lighting and general-use receptacles. The floor area for each floor shall be calculated from the outside dimensions of the dwelling unit. The calculated floor area shall not include open porches, garages, or unused or unfinished spaces not adaptable for future use.\n\n- (2) 1500  volt-amperes for each 2-wire, 20-ampere smallappliance branch circuit and each laundry branch circuit covered in 210.11(C)(1) and (C)(2).\n\n- (3) The nameplate rating of the following:\n\n- a. All appliances that are fastened in place, permanently connected, or located to be on a specific circuit\n- b. Ranges, wall-mounted ovens, counter-mounted cooking units\n- c. Clothes dryers that are not connected to the laundry branch circuit specified in item (2)\n- d. Water heaters\n- (4) The nameplate ampere or kVA rating of all permanently connected motors not included in item (3).\n\n\n##### (C) Heating and Air-Conditioning Load. The largest of the following six selections (load in kV A) shall be included:\n\n\n- (1) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the air conditioning and cooling.\n\n- (2) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump when the heat pump is used without any supplemental electric heating.\n\n- (3) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump compressor and 65 percent of the supplemental electric heating for central electric space-heating systems. If the heat pump compressor is prevented from operating at the same time as the supplementary heat, it does not need to be added to the supplementary heat for the total central space heating load.\n\n- (4) 65 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if less than four separately controlled units.\n\n- (5) 40 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if four or more separately controlled units.\n\n- (6) 100  percent of the nameplate ratings of electric thermal storage and other heating systems where the usual load is\n\n\nexpected to be continuous at the full nameplate value. Systems qualifying under this selection shall not be calculated under any other selection in 220.82(C).\n\nResult 5 [CEC 2022 Section 220.40] (relevance: 9.79)\n#### 220.40 General\n\nThe calculated load of a feeder or service shall not be less than the sum of the loads on the branch circuits supplied, as determined by Part II of this article, after any applicable demand factors permitted by Part III or IV or required by Part V have been applied.\n\nInformational Note: See Examples D1(a) through D10 in Informative Annex D.

      "answer": "## AFCI Protection in Bedrooms and Living Areas (CEC 2022)\n\n**Requirement**:  \nArc-fault circuit-interrupter (AFCI) protection is required for **15- and 20-ampere, 120-volt branch circuits** supplying outlets in dwelling unit bedrooms, living rooms, and similar areas (Section 210.12(A)). This includes family rooms, dining rooms, dens, sunrooms, recreation rooms, and hallways.\n\n**Electrical Hazard Prevented**:  \nAFCI protection prevents **electrical fires caused by arc faults**. Arc faults occur when damaged or degraded wiring creates high-resistance connections, generating heat that can ignite surrounding materials. Common causes include:  \n- Damaged cords or appliances  \n- Loose or corroded connections  \n- Rodent-chewed wiring  \n- Overloaded circuits  \n\n**Key Details**:  \n- **Arc Fault Mechanism**: Arcs can reach temperatures exceeding 10,000°F (5,500°C), easily igniting wood, insulation, or other flammable materials.  \n- **AFCI Function**: Detects unique electrical signatures of dangerous arcs (e.g., series arcs in damaged wiring) and interrupts the circuit before a fire starts.  \n- **Scope**: Applies to **outlet branch circuits** (not feeders) in areas where arcing is more likely due to frequent use of portable devices and higher wiring density.  \n\n**Code Basis**:  \n- **CEC 2022 Section 210.12(A)** explicitly mandates AFCI protection for these areas.  \n- **Informational Note**: References UL 1699 standards and NFPA 72 for fire alarm systems, emphasizing fire prevention.  \n\n**Inspector Note**:  \nAFCI requirements **do not apply to GFCI-protected circuits** (e.g., bathrooms, kitchens) or dedicated circuits for fire alarm systems. Always verify the first outlet location and marking per 210.12(A)(2)–(6) for compliance.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

This includes family rooms, dining rooms, dens, sunrooms, recreation rooms, and hallways.\n\n**Electrical Hazard Prevented**:  \nAFCI protection prevents **electrical fires caused by arc faults**. Arc faults occur when damaged or degraded wiring creates high-resistance connections, generating heat that can ignite surrounding materials. Common causes include:  \n- Damaged cords or appliances  \n- Loose or corroded connections  \n- Rodent-chewed wiring  \n- Overloaded circuits  \n\n**Key Details**:  \n- **Arc Fault Mechanism**: Arcs can reach temperatures exceeding 10,000°F (5,500°C), easily igniting wood, insulation, or other flammable materials.  \n- **AFCI Function**: Detects unique electrical signatures of dangerous arcs (e.g., series arcs in damaged wiring) and interrupts the circuit before a fire starts.  \n- **Scope**: Applies to **outlet branch circuits** (not feeders) in areas where arcing is more likely due to frequent use of portable devices and higher wiring density.  \n\n**Code Basis**:  \n- **CEC 2022 Section 210.12(A)** explicitly mandates AFCI protection for these areas.  \n- **Informational Note**: References UL 1699 standards and NFPA 72 for fire alarm systems, emphasizing fire prevention.  \n\n**Inspector Note**:  \nAFCI requirements **do not apply to GFCI-protected circuits** (e.g., bathrooms, kitchens) or dedicated circuits for fire alarm systems. Always verify the first outlet location and marking per 210.12(A)(2)–(6) for compliance.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Improper torque can lead to:\n- **Under-torqued connections**: Loose terminations causing arcing, overheating, and potential fire hazards.\n- **Over-torqued connections**: Damaged conductors or terminals, leading to mechanical failure or compromised conductivity.\n\n### Requirements Location\nThe California Electrical Code (CEC 2022) addresses torque specifications in **Section 110.14(D)**:\n\n#### **CEC 2022 Section 110.14(D) - Terminal Connection Torque**\n> \"Tightening torque values for terminal connections shall be as indicated on equipment or in installation instructions provided by the manufacturer. An approved means shall be used to achieve the indicated torque value.\"\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n1. **Manufacturer Specifications**: Torque values must match those marked on the equipment or in the manufacturer's installation instructions.\n2. **Approved Tools**: Use torque tools, shear bolts, or breakaway devices to verify proper torque application.\n3. **Documentation**: If torque values are not provided, contact the equipment manufacturer for guidance (referenced in informational notes).\n\n### Additional Context\n- **Control Circuits**: Section 430.9(C) specifies a **minimum torque of 0.8 N·m (7 lb-in.)** for screw-type terminals using 14 AWG or smaller copper conductors in motor control circuits.\n- **Temperature Coordination**: Section 110.14(C) requires conductor ampacity to align with termination temperature ratings (e.g., 60°C or 75°C), which indirectly affects torque requirements by dictating conductor selection.\n\n### Inspector Note\nAlways verify torque values **per the equipment manufacturer's instructions**, as these can vary by device type and application. Failure to follow these specifications violates CEC 110.14(D) and creates a fire hazard.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 3 [CEC 2022 Section 330.112] (relevance: 0.45)\n#### 330.112 Insulation\n\nInsulated conductors shall comply with 330.112(A) or (B).\n\n##### (A) 1000 Volts or Less.

The calculated floor area shall not include open porches, garages, or unused or unfinished spaces not adaptable for future use.\n\n- (2) 1500  volt-amperes for each 2-wire, 20-ampere smallappliance branch circuit and each laundry branch circuit covered in 210.11(C)(1) and (C)(2).\n\n- (3) The nameplate rating of the following:\n\n- a. All appliances that are fastened in place, permanently connected, or located to be on a specific circuit\n- b. Ranges, wall-mounted ovens, counter-mounted cooking units\n- c. Clothes dryers that are not connected to the laundry branch circuit specified in item (2)\n- d. Water heaters\n- (4) The nameplate ampere or kVA rating of all permanently connected motors not included in item (3).\n\n\n##### (C) Heating and Air-Conditioning Load. The largest of the following six selections (load in kV A) shall be included:\n\n\n- (1) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the air conditioning and cooling.\n\n- (2) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump when the heat pump is used without any supplemental electric heating.\n\n- (3) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump compressor and 65 percent of the supplemental electric heating for central electric space-heating systems. If the heat pump compressor is prevented from operating at the same time as the supplementary heat, it does not need to be added to the supplementary heat for the total central space heating load.\n\n- (4) 65 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if less than four separately controlled units.\n\n- (5) 40 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of electric space heating if four or more separately controlled units.\n\n- (6) 100  percent of the nameplate ratings of electric thermal storage and other heating systems where the usual load is\n\n\nexpected to be continuous at the full nameplate value. Systems qualifying under this selection shall not be calculated under any other selection in 220.82(C).\n\n\n============================================================\n[REFERENCED TABLE DATA - Use these exact values]\n============================================================\n### Table 220.12: General Lighting Loads by Non-Dwelling Occupancy\ntype_of_occupancy | volt_amperes_per_m2 | volt_amperes_per_ft2\n--- | --- | ---\nAutomotive facility | 16 | 1.5\nConvention center | 15 | 1.4\nCourthouse | 15 | 1.4\nDormitory | 16 | 1.5\nExercise center | 15 | 1.4\nFire station | 14 | 1.3\nGymnasium | 18 | 1.7\nHealth care clinic | 17 | 1.6\nHospital | 17 | 1.6\nHotels and motels, including a | 18 | 1.7\nLibrary | 16 | 1.5\nManufacturing facility | 24 | 2.2\nMotion picture theater | 17 | 1.6\nMuseum | 17 | 1.6\nOffice | 14 | 1.3\n\n**Footnotes:**\n  [general] The 125 percent multiplier for a continuous load as specified in 210.20(A) is included when using the unit loads in this table for calculating the minimum lighting load for a specified occupancy.\n  [a] Armories and auditoriums are considered gymnasium-type occupancies.\n  [b] Lodge rooms are similar to hotels and motels.\n  [c] Industrial commercial loft buildings are considered manufacturing-type occupancies.\n  [d] Banks are office-type occupancies.",
