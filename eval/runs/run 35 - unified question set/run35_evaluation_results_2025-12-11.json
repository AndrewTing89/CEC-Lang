      "answer": "## Surge Protection for Residential Service (CEC 2022)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe California Electrical Code (CEC) 2022 **does not explicitly require surge protection** (surge protective devices or SPDs) for residential services. However, if surge protection is installed, it **must comply with grounding and bonding requirements** in Article 250.\n\n### Key Code References:\n1. **Grounding Electrode System (250.24, 250.64):**  \n   Surge protection devices (if installed) must be connected to the grounding electrode system per Table 250.66 for proper bonding.  \n   - Example: For a 200A service, the grounding electrode conductor must be at least **4 AWG copper** (Table 250.66).\n\n2. **Equipment Grounding (250.114, 250.142):**  \n   SPDs must be bonded to the equipment grounding conductor. For a 200A service, the equipment grounding conductor is typically **6 AWG copper** (Table 250.122).\n\n### Installer Guidance:\n- **Location:** If installed, surge protection should be placed **at the service entrance** (near the main service panel) to protect the entire electrical system.\n- **Compliance:** Follow manufacturer instructions and ensure SPDs are listed for use in accordance with CEC Article 40.1 (Listing and Labeling).\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

      "tier": "core",
      "answer": "## Grounding and Bonding Configuration for Detached Garage Subpanel (CEC 2022)\n\n### Key Requirements:\n1. **Separate Neutral and Ground Buses**  \n   - In the subpanel, **neutral and equipment grounding conductors (EGC) must be on separate buses** (no bonding). This prevents parallel paths for fault current.  \n   - **Bonding is only allowed at the main service panel** (CEC 250.24(B)).\n\n2. **Grounding Electrode System**  \n   - A **local grounding electrode** (e.g., ground rod) must be installed at the detached garage.  \n   - The **grounding electrode conductor (GEC)** connects this electrode to the **grounding bus** in the subpanel (CEC 250.32(A)).  \n\n3. **Equipment Grounding Conductor (EGC)**  \n   - The 4-wire feeder includes an **EGC** that connects the subpanel’s grounding bus to the main panel’s grounding system. This ensures fault current returns to the source.  \n\n4. **Neutral-to-Ground Bonding**  \n   - The **neutral conductor** from the feeder connects to the **neutral bus** in the subpanel.  \n   - **No bonding** is allowed between neutral and ground in the subpanel (CEC 250.24(D)).  \n\n5. **Bonding of Grounding Electrodes**  \n   - All grounding electrodes (e.g., water pipe, concrete-encased electrode) at the garage must be **bonded together** and connected to the grounding electrode system (CEC 250.50).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n1. **Subpanel Configuration**  \n   - Install a subpanel with **separated neutral and grounding buses**.  \n   - Connect the **neutral conductor** from the feeder to the neutral bus.  \n   - Connect the **EGC** from the feeder to the grounding bus.  \n\n2. **Grounding Electrode Installation**  \n   - Drive a **ground rod** (8 ft minimum) at the garage.  \n   - Connect it to the grounding bus using a **GEC** sized per **Table 250.66** based on the feeder conductor size.  \n\n3. **Bonding Jumper (if required)**  \n   - If the garage has a metal water pipe, bond it to the grounding electrode system with a **bonding jumper** (CEC 250.50).  \n\n---\n\n### Example Sizing (for a 100A Feeder):\n- **Feeder Conductors**: 3/0 AWG copper (ungrounded), 2/0 AWG copper (neutral).  \n- **EGC**: 6 AWG copper (per Table 250.122 for 100A).  \n- **GEC**: 6 AWG copper (per Table 250.66 for 2/0 AWG neutral).  \n\n---\n\n### Inspector Notes:\n- **No neutral-to-ground bond** in the subpanel.  \n- **All grounding electrodes** at the garage must be interconnected.  \n- Verify the **main panel** has a proper grounding electrode system per CEC 250.50.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Sections 250.24, 250.30, 250.32, 250.50, 250.66",

This prevents parallel paths for fault current.  \n   - **Bonding is only allowed at the main service panel** (CEC 250.24(B)).\n\n2. **Grounding Electrode System**  \n   - A **local grounding electrode** (e.g., ground rod) must be installed at the detached garage.  \n   - The **grounding electrode conductor (GEC)** connects this electrode to the **grounding bus** in the subpanel (CEC 250.32(A)).  \n\n3. **Equipment Grounding Conductor (EGC)**  \n   - The 4-wire feeder includes an **EGC** that connects the subpanel’s grounding bus to the main panel’s grounding system. This ensures fault current returns to the source.  \n\n4. **Neutral-to-Ground Bonding**  \n   - The **neutral conductor** from the feeder connects to the **neutral bus** in the subpanel.  \n   - **No bonding** is allowed between neutral and ground in the subpanel (CEC 250.24(D)).  \n\n5. **Bonding of Grounding Electrodes**  \n   - All grounding electrodes (e.g., water pipe, concrete-encased electrode) at the garage must be **bonded together** and connected to the grounding electrode system (CEC 250.50).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n1. **Subpanel Configuration**  \n   - Install a subpanel with **separated neutral and grounding buses**.  \n   - Connect the **neutral conductor** from the feeder to the neutral bus.  \n   - Connect the **EGC** from the feeder to the grounding bus.  \n\n2. **Grounding Electrode Installation**  \n   - Drive a **ground rod** (8 ft minimum) at the garage.  \n   - Connect it to the grounding bus using a **GEC** sized per **Table 250.66** based on the feeder conductor size.  \n\n3. **Bonding Jumper (if required)**  \n   - If the garage has a metal water pipe, bond it to the grounding electrode system with a **bonding jumper** (CEC 250.50).  \n\n---\n\n### Example Sizing (for a 100A Feeder):\n- **Feeder Conductors**: 3/0 AWG copper (ungrounded), 2/0 AWG copper (neutral).  \n- **EGC**: 6 AWG copper (per Table 250.122 for 100A).  \n- **GEC**: 6 AWG copper (per Table 250.66 for 2/0 AWG neutral).  \n\n---\n\n### Inspector Notes:\n- **No neutral-to-ground bond** in the subpanel.  \n- **All grounding electrodes** at the garage must be interconnected.  \n- Verify the **main panel** has a proper grounding electrode system per CEC 250.50.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Sections 250.24, 250.30, 250.32, 250.50, 250.66",

      "answer": "## AFCI Protection in Bedrooms and Living Areas (CEC 2022)\n\n**Requirement**:  \nAFCI protection is required for all 120V, 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits supplying outlets in dwelling unit bedrooms, living rooms, and similar areas (Section 210.12(A)).  \n\n**Electrical Hazard Prevented**:  \nAFCI protection prevents **electrical fires caused by arc faults**. Arc faults occur when damaged, worn, or loose wiring creates high-temperature electrical arcs (typically 3,000–10,000°F). These arcs can ignite surrounding materials, leading to fires. Standard circuit breakers do not detect arcs but only respond to overcurrents (overloads/short circuits).  \n\n**Why Bedrooms/Living Areas?**  \nThese areas are high-risk for arc faults due to:  \n- Frequent use of portable appliances and cords.  \n- Concealed wiring in walls susceptible to damage during renovations.  \n- High occupancy, increasing the likelihood of fire spread.  \n\n**Code Basis**:  \n- **Section 210.12(A)** explicitly mandates AFCI protection for these areas.  \n- **Informational Note 1** references UL 1699 standards, which define how AFCIs detect arcs.  \n\n**Inspector Note**:  \nAFCIs are critical for safety in residential spaces where arc faults are more likely to go undetected by standard breakers.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Arc faults occur when damaged, worn, or loose wiring creates high-temperature electrical arcs (typically 3,000–10,000°F). These arcs can ignite surrounding materials, leading to fires. Standard circuit breakers do not detect arcs but only respond to overcurrents (overloads/short circuits).  \n\n**Why Bedrooms/Living Areas?**  \nThese areas are high-risk for arc faults due to:  \n- Frequent use of portable appliances and cords.  \n- Concealed wiring in walls susceptible to damage during renovations.  \n- High occupancy, increasing the likelihood of fire spread.  \n\n**Code Basis**:  \n- **Section 210.12(A)** explicitly mandates AFCI protection for these areas.  \n- **Informational Note 1** references UL 1699 standards, which define how AFCIs detect arcs.  \n\n**Inspector Note**:  \nAFCIs are critical for safety in residential spaces where arc faults are more likely to go undetected by standard breakers.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

The **3% recommendation** is advisory (per IEEE 141).  \n\n3. **Conclusion**:  \n   - Your calculation of **2.37% voltage drop** meets the **IEEE 141 recommendation** (3% max).  \n   - Since the CEC does not mandate stricter limits for this scenario, the installation is **acceptable**.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

The **3% recommendation** is advisory (per IEEE 141).  \n\n3. **Conclusion**:  \n   - Your calculation of **2.37% voltage drop** meets the **IEEE 141 recommendation** (3% max).  \n   - Since the CEC does not mandate stricter limits for this scenario, the installation is **acceptable**.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

The panelboard must accommodate this breaker size and type.  \n\n3. **General Panelboard Compliance**  \n   - Panelboards must comply with **CEC 408.36** for overcurrent protection (e.g., total panel rating ≥ branch circuit breakers) and **408.40** for grounding.  \n\n---\n\n### Inspector Notes:\n- **California Energy Code References**: The exact number of required spaces or specific sizing rules may depend on the California Energy Code (not fully detailed in CEC 2022 text). Verify local jurisdiction interpretations of Sections 150.0 or 160.9.  \n- **Future-Proofing**: California mandates often require panelboards to be \"ready\" for electrification (e.g., EVs, heat pumps). Ensure additional spaces align with broader Energy Code provisions.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 9 [CEC 2022 Section 392.22(A)] (relevance: 0.32)\n##### (A) Number of Multiconductor Cables, Rated 2000 Volts or Less, in Cable Trays.

For flexible cords, see Table 400.4, Table 400.5(A)(a), and Table 400.5(A)(b).\n\n## (B) Ambient Temperature Correction Factors. ∆\n\n- (1) General. Ampacities for ambient temperatures other than those shown in the ampacity tables shall be corrected in accordance with Table 310.15(B)(1) or Table 310.15(B)(2), or shall be permitted to be calculated using Equation 310.15(B). N\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nI ′ = ampacity corrected for ambient temperature\n\nI = ampacity shown in the tables\n\nTc = temperature rating of conductor (°C)\n\nTa ′ = new ambient temperature (°C)\n\nTa = ambient temperature used in the table (°C)\n\n- (2) Rooftop. For raceways or cables exposed to direct sunlight on or above rooftops where the distance above the roof to the bottom of the raceway or cable is less than 23  mm ( 7 /8 in.), a temperature adder of 33°C (60°F) shall be added to the outdoor temperature to determine the applicable ambient temperature for application of the correction factors in Table 310.15(B)(1) or Table 310.15(B)(2). N\n\n\nException: Type XHHW-2 insulated conductors shall not be subject to this ampacity adjustment.\n\n## Table 310.15(B)(1) Ambient Temperature Correction Factors Based on 30°C (86°F) ∆\n\n\n## Table 310.15(B)(2) Ambient Temperature Correction Factors Based on 40ºC (104ºF) ∆\n\nFor ambient temperatures other than 40°C (104°F), multiply the ampacities specified in the ampacity tables by the appropriate correction factor shown below.\n\n\n## Table 310.15(C)(1) Adjustment Factors for More Than Three Current-Carrying Conductors ∆\n\n\n*Number of conductors is the total number of conductors in the raceway or cable, including spare conductors. The count shall be adjusted in accordance with 310.15(E) and (F). The count shall not include conductors that are connected to electrical components that cannot be simultaneously energized.\n\nInformational Note: One source for the ambient temperatures in various locations is the ASHRAE Handbook Fundamentals .\n\n## (C) Adjustment Factors. ∆\n\n- (1) More than Three Current-Carrying Conductors. The ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced as shown in Table 310.15(C)(1) where the number of current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable exceeds three, or where single conductors or multiconductor cables not installed in raceways are installed without maintaining spacing for a continuous length longer than 600 mm (24  in.). Each current-carrying conductor of a paralleled set of conductors shall be counted as a current- carrying conductor. N\n\n\nWhere conductors of different systems, as provided in 300.3, are installed in a common raceway or cable, the adjustment factors shown in Table 310.15(C)(1) shall apply only to the number of power and lighting conductors (Articles 210, 215, 220, and 230).\n\nInformational Note No. 1: See Annex B for adjustment factors for more than three current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable with load diversity.\n\nInformational Note No.  2: See 366.23 for adjustment factors for conductors and ampacity for bare copper and aluminum bars in auxiliary gutters and 376.22(B) for adjustment factors for conductors in metal wireways.\n\n(a) Where conductors are installed in cable trays, the provisions of 392.80 shall apply.\n\n(b) Adjustment factors shall not apply to conductors in raceways having a length not exceeding 600 mm (24 in.).\n\n(c) Adjustment factors shall not apply to underground conductors entering or leaving an outdoor trench if those conductors have physical protection in the form of rigid metal conduit, intermediate metal conduit, rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit (PVC), or reinforced thermosetting resin conduit (RTRC) having a length not exceeding 3.05 m (10 ft), and if the number of conductors does not exceed four.\n\n(d) Adjustment factors shall not apply to Type AC cable or to Type MC cable under the following conditions:\n\n- (1) The cables do not have an overall outer jacket.\n\n- (2) Each cable has not more than three current-carrying conductors.\n\n- (3) The conductors are 12 AWG copper.\n\n- (4) Not more than 20 current-carrying conductors are installed without maintaining spacing, are stacked, or are supported on 'bridle rings.'\n\n\nException to (4): If cables meeting the requirements in 310.15(C) (1)(d)(1) through (C)(1)(d)(3) with more than 20  current-carrying conductors are installed longer than 600  mm (24  in.) without maintaining spacing, are stacked, or are supported on bridle rings, a 60 percent adjustment factor shall be applied.\n\n- (2) Raceway Spacing. Spacing between raceways shall be maintained. N\n\n\n##### (D) Bare or Covered Conductors. Where bare or covered conductors are installed with insulated conductors, the temperature rating of the bare or covered conductor shall be equal to the lowest temperature rating of the insulated conductors for the purpose of determining ampacity.\n\n\n##### (E) Neutral Conductor. Neutral conductors shall be considered current carrying in accordance with any of the following: ∆\n\n- (1) A neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be required to be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (2) In a 3-wire circuit consisting of two phase conductors and the neutral conductor of a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system, a common conductor carries approximately the same current as the line-to-neutral load currents of the other conductors and shall be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1).\n\n- (3) On a 4-wire, 3-phase wye circuit where the major portion of the load consists of nonlinear loads, harmonic currents are present in the neutral conductor; the neutral conductor shall therefore be considered a current-carrying conductor.\n\n##### (F) Grounding or Bonding Conductor. A grounding or bonding conductor shall not be counted when applying the provisions of 310.15(C)(1). ∆\n\nException 3 [CEC 2022 Section 355.60] (relevance: 0.49)\n#### 355.60 Grounding\n\nWhere equipment grounding is required, a separate equipment grounding conductor shall be installed in the conduit. ∆\n\nException  No.  1: As permitted in 250.134, Exception No.  2, for dc circuits and 250.134, Exception No. 1, for separately run equipment grounding conductors.\n\nTable 355.44 Expansion Characteristics of Reinforced Thermosetting Resin Conduit (RTRC) Coefficient of Thermal Expansion = 2.7 × 10 -5 mm/mm/°C (1.5 × 10 -5 in./in./°F)\n\n\nException No. 2: Where the grounded conductor is used to ground equipment as permitted in 250.142.\n\nException 4 [CEC 2022 Section 352.60] (relevance: 0.46)\n#### 352.60 Grounding\n\nWhere equipment grounding is required, a separate equipment grounding conductor shall be installed in the conduit. ∆\n\nException No. 1: As permitted in 250.134, Exception No. 2, for dc circuits and 250.134, Exception No. 1, for separately run equipment grounding conductors.\n\nException No. 2: Where the grounded conductor is used to ground equipment as permitted in 250.142.\n\nException 5 [CEC 2022 Section 356.60] (relevance: 0.46)\n#### 356.60 Grounding\n\nWhere equipment grounding is required, a separate equipment grounding conductor shall be installed in the conduit. ∆\n\nException No. 1: As permitted in 250.134, Exception No. 2, for dc circuits and 250.134, Exception No. 1, for separately run equipment grounding conductors.\n\nException No. 2: Where the grounded conductor is used to ground equipment as permitted in 250.142.\n",

Other outlets not covered in 220.14(A) through (K) shall be calculated based on 180 volt-amperes per outlet.\n\n\n##### (M) Hotel and Motel Occupancies. In guest rooms or guest suites of hotels and motels, the lighting and receptacle outlets specified in 220.14(M)(1), (M)(2), and (M)(3) are included in the minimum unit load in Table 220.12. No additional load calculations shall be required for such outlets. The minimum lighting load shall be determined using the minimum unit load and the floor area as determined in 220.11 for hotel and motel occupancies. N\n\n- (1) All general-use receptacle outlets of 20-ampere rating or less, including receptacles connected to the circuits in 210.11(C) (3) and 210.11(C)(4)\n\n- (2) The receptacle outlets specified in 210.52(E)(3)\n\n- (3) The lighting outlets specified in 210.70\n\nResult 5 [CEC 2022 Section 220.102] (relevance: 31.59)\n#### 220.102 Farm Loads - Buildings and Other Loads\n\n\n##### (A) Dwelling Unit. The feeder or service load of a farm dwelling unit shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions for dwellings in Part III or IV of this article. Where the dwelling has electric heat and the farm has electric grain-drying systems, Part IV of this article shall not be used to calculate the dwelling load where the dwelling and farm loads are supplied by a common service.\n\n\n##### (B) Other Than Dwelling Unit. Where a feeder or service supplies a farm building or other load having two or more separate branch circuits, the load for feeders, service conductors, and service equipment shall be calculated in accordance with demand factors not less than indicated in Table 220.102.\n\n\n============================================================\n[REFERENCED TABLE DATA - Use these exact values]\n============================================================\n### Table 220.12: General Lighting Loads by Non-Dwelling Occupancy\ntype_of_occupancy | volt_amperes_per_m2 | volt_amperes_per_ft2\n--- | --- | ---\nAutomotive facility | 16 | 1.5\nConvention center | 15 | 1.4\nCourthouse | 15 | 1.4\nDormitory | 16 | 1.5\nExercise center | 15 | 1.4\nFire station | 14 | 1.3\nGymnasium | 18 | 1.7\nHealth care clinic | 17 | 1.6\nHospital | 17 | 1.6\nHotels and motels, including a | 18 | 1.7\nLibrary | 16 | 1.5\nManufacturing facility | 24 | 2.2\nMotion picture theater | 17 | 1.6\nMuseum | 17 | 1.6\nOffice | 14 | 1.3\n\n**Footnotes:**\n  [general] The 125 percent multiplier for a continuous load as specified in 210.20(A) is included when using the unit loads in this table for calculating the minimum lighting load for a specified occupancy.\n  [a] Armories and auditoriums are considered gymnasium-type occupancies.\n  [b] Lodge rooms are similar to hotels and motels.\n  [c] Industrial commercial loft buildings are considered manufacturing-type occupancies.\n  [d] Banks are office-type occupancies.\n\n### Table 220.84: Optional Calculations — Demand Factors for Three or More Multifamily Dwelling Units\nrow_label | values\n--- | ---\n3–5 | Demand Factor (%): 45\n6–7 | Demand Factor (%): 44\n8–10 | Demand Factor (%): 43\n11 | Demand Factor (%): 42\n12–13 | Demand Factor (%): 41\n14–15 | Demand Factor (%): 40\n16–17 | Demand Factor (%): 39\n18–20 | Demand Factor (%): 38\n21 | Demand Factor (%): 37\n22–23 | Demand Factor (%): 36\n24–25 | Demand Factor (%): 35\n26–27 | Demand Factor (%): 34\n28–30 | Demand Factor (%): 33\n31 | Demand Factor (%): 32\n32–33 | Demand Factor (%): 31",
