This requirement was not captured in the initial search due to an article filter, but a broader search confirmed the mandate.\n\n### Key Code Requirements:\n1. **Section 230.67(A)**:  \n   *\"All services supplying dwelling units shall be provided with a surge-protective device (SPD).\"*  \n   - **Type**: Must be Type 1 or Type 2 SPD.  \n   - **Location**:  \n     - Integral to service equipment, or  \n     - Located immediately adjacent to service equipment.  \n     - **Exception**: SPD may be installed downstream at the next level of distribution if not in service equipment.  \n\n2. **Section 230.67(D)**:  \n   If service equipment is replaced, the SPD requirement must still be applied.  \n\n### Additional Context:\n- **Section 230.94** allows SPDs to be installed on the supply side of the service disconnect (e.g., for metering or fire alarm systems), but this does not negate the requirement in 230.67.  \n- **Section 230.209** permits surge arresters on overhead service conductors but does not replace the SPD requirement for dwelling units.  \n\n### Inspector Note:\n- **California mandates SPDs** for residential services in CEC 2022 (Section 230.67), even if the 2023 NEC may have similar language.  \n- Verify local amendments, as some jurisdictions may adopt additional requirements.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022  \n\n[VERIFIED] Answer is complete.",

This requirement was not captured in the initial search due to an article filter, but a broader search confirmed the mandate.\n\n### Key Code Requirements:\n1. **Section 230.67(A)**:  \n   *\"All services supplying dwelling units shall be provided with a surge-protective device (SPD).\"*  \n   - **Type**: Must be Type 1 or Type 2 SPD.  \n   - **Location**:  \n     - Integral to service equipment, or  \n     - Located immediately adjacent to service equipment.  \n     - **Exception**: SPD may be installed downstream at the next level of distribution if not in service equipment.  \n\n2. **Section 230.67(D)**:  \n   If service equipment is replaced, the SPD requirement must still be applied.  \n\n### Additional Context:\n- **Section 230.94** allows SPDs to be installed on the supply side of the service disconnect (e.g., for metering or fire alarm systems), but this does not negate the requirement in 230.67.  \n- **Section 230.209** permits surge arresters on overhead service conductors but does not replace the SPD requirement for dwelling units.  \n\n### Inspector Note:\n- **California mandates SPDs** for residential services in CEC 2022 (Section 230.67), even if the 2023 NEC may have similar language.  \n- Verify local amendments, as some jurisdictions may adopt additional requirements.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022  \n\n[VERIFIED] Answer is complete.",

      "answer": "[VERIFIED] Answer is complete.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nYes, this is a **code violation** under CEC 2022.  \n\n**Key Requirements:**  \n1. **Terminal Marking Requirement**  \n   - **CEC 2022 Section 110.14(A)** explicitly requires that conductors be connected to terminals in a manner consistent with the terminal's marking. Terminals not marked for multiple conductors (e.g., \"2-wire\") are limited to one conductor per terminal.  \n\n2. **Breaker Terminal Limitations**  \n   - The breaker in question is **not marked for two conductors**, so connecting two 12 AWG conductors violates this rule.  \n\n3. **Relevant Sections**  \n   - **CEC 2022 Section 240.91(A)** reinforces conductor protection rules but does not override termination requirements.  \n\n**Exceptions Checked:**  \n- No exceptions to **110.14(A)** apply here. Cross-referenced sections (e.g., 215.2, 250.148) address feeder sizing, grounding, or insulation, not terminal markings.  \n\n**Corrective Action:**  \n- Use a breaker with a terminal marked for two conductors or install a junction box to combine conductors before termination.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Terminals not marked for multiple conductors (e.g., \"2-wire\") are limited to one conductor per terminal.  \n\n2. **Breaker Terminal Limitations**  \n   - The breaker in question is **not marked for two conductors**, so connecting two 12 AWG conductors violates this rule.  \n\n3. **Relevant Sections**  \n   - **CEC 2022 Section 240.91(A)** reinforces conductor protection rules but does not override termination requirements.  \n\n**Exceptions Checked:**  \n- No exceptions to **110.14(A)** apply here. Cross-referenced sections (e.g., 215.2, 250.148) address feeder sizing, grounding, or insulation, not terminal markings.  \n\n**Corrective Action:**  \n- Use a breaker with a terminal marked for two conductors or install a junction box to combine conductors before termination.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

      "question": "Why does the NEC require AFCI protection for bedrooms and living areas? What electrical hazard does it prevent?",
      "answer": "## AFCI Protection Requirements in Bedrooms and Living Areas (CEC 2022)\n\n### **Why AFCI Protection is Required**\nThe NEC (and CEC 2022) mandates **Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI)** protection for 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits in dwelling unit bedrooms, living rooms, and similar areas **to prevent electrical fires caused by arc faults**. This requirement is explicitly stated in **Section 210.12(A)**, which lists these spaces as mandatory for AFCI coverage.\n\n---\n\n### **What Hazard Does AFCI Prevent?**\nAFCIs are designed to detect and interrupt **series arcs** (e.g., from damaged cords, loose connections, or deteriorating wiring) that can ignite surrounding materials. Key points from the code:\n- **Arc faults** generate high heat (up to 10,000°F) and can start fires in walls, ceilings, or furniture.\n- Standard circuit breakers do not reliably detect arcs; AFCIs use advanced electronics to recognize arc signatures.\n- **Section 100** defines AFCIs as devices that \"function to de-energize the circuit when an arc fault is detected.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Code Basis**\n- **CEC 2022 Section 210.12(A):** Requires AFCI protection for all 120V, 15/20A circuits in dwelling unit areas including:\n  - Bedrooms\n  - Living rooms\n  - Hallways\n  - Closets\n  - Laundry areas\n- **Exceptions:** None apply to typical residential scenarios (e.g., fire alarm systems are excluded but not relevant here).\n\n---\n\n### **Inspector Note**\n- AFCI protection is **not interchangeable with GFCI** (which prevents shocks). Both may be required in the same location (e.g., kitchen outlets need both AFCI and GFCI).\n- Verify AFCI coverage during inspections by checking the panel for labeled AFCI breakers or outlet-mounted AFCIs.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

This requirement is explicitly stated in **Section 210.12(A)**, which lists these spaces as mandatory for AFCI coverage.\n\n---\n\n### **What Hazard Does AFCI Prevent?**\nAFCIs are designed to detect and interrupt **series arcs** (e.g., from damaged cords, loose connections, or deteriorating wiring) that can ignite surrounding materials. Key points from the code:\n- **Arc faults** generate high heat (up to 10,000°F) and can start fires in walls, ceilings, or furniture.\n- Standard circuit breakers do not reliably detect arcs; AFCIs use advanced electronics to recognize arc signatures.\n- **Section 100** defines AFCIs as devices that \"function to de-energize the circuit when an arc fault is detected.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Code Basis**\n- **CEC 2022 Section 210.12(A):** Requires AFCI protection for all 120V, 15/20A circuits in dwelling unit areas including:\n  - Bedrooms\n  - Living rooms\n  - Hallways\n  - Closets\n  - Laundry areas\n- **Exceptions:** None apply to typical residential scenarios (e.g., fire alarm systems are excluded but not relevant here).\n\n---\n\n### **Inspector Note**\n- AFCI protection is **not interchangeable with GFCI** (which prevents shocks). Both may be required in the same location (e.g., kitchen outlets need both AFCI and GFCI).\n- Verify AFCI coverage during inspections by checking the panel for labeled AFCI breakers or outlet-mounted AFCIs.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Inspector notes: (1) neutral bar and ground bar are bonded together with main bonding jumper installed, (2) ground bar is bonded to metal enclosure, (3) neutral bar is bonded to metal enclosure, (4) feeder ground wire is connected to ground bar, (5) feeder neutral is connected to neutral bar. Identify all violations and explain correct configuration.",
      "answer": "## Subpanel Grounding Violations and Correct Configuration (CEC 2022)\n\n### **Identified Violations**\n1. **Neutral and Ground Bars Bonded Together**  \n   - **Violation**: Section 250.32(B)(1) requires the *equipment grounding conductor* to connect to the grounding electrode system but **not** to the neutral. Bonding neutral and ground bars in a subpanel creates a parallel ground path and violates the \"separately derived system\" grounding rules.  \n   - **Correct Action**: Isolate the neutral and ground bars in the subpanel. The neutral bar should only connect to the feeder neutral conductor, and the ground bar should only connect to the equipment grounding conductor and grounding electrode.\n\n2. **Neutral Bar Bonded to Metal Enclosure**  \n   - **Violation**: Section 250.32(B)(1) prohibits connecting the neutral to the metal enclosure in a subpanel. This creates a direct bond between neutral and ground, which is only permitted at the **main service panel** (Section 250.24(B)).  \n   - **Correct Action**: Remove the bonding jumper between the neutral bar and the metal enclosure. The neutral bar must remain electrically isolated from the enclosure in a subpanel.\n\n3. **Missing Grounding Electrode at Detached Structure**  \n   - **Violation**: Section 250.32(A) mandates a **separate grounding electrode** (e.g., ground rod) at the detached garage unless the subpanel is supplied by a single branch circuit (not the case here).  \n   - **Correct Action**: Install a grounding electrode (e.g., 8 ft copper rod) at the detached garage. Connect it to the ground bar via a grounding electrode conductor sized per Table 250.66 (based on feeder conductor size).\n\n---\n\n### **Correct Configuration**\n1. **Feeder Conductors**  \n   - **Hot/Neutral**: #2 AWG aluminum (2 hots, 1 neutral) connected to the neutral bar.  \n   - **Ground**: #2 AWG aluminum (equipment grounding conductor) connected to the ground bar.  \n\n2. **Panel Bonding**  \n   - **Ground Bar**: Bonded to the metal enclosure (per 250.142(B)).  \n   - **Neutral Bar**: Isolated from the ground bar and enclosure.  \n\n3. **Grounding Electrode System**  \n   - Install a grounding electrode (e.g., ground rod) at the detached garage.  \n   - Connect the electrode to the ground bar using a grounding electrode conductor sized per Table 250.66 (for #2 AWG aluminum feeder, use **#6 AWG copper** or **#4 AWG aluminum**).  \n\n4. **Bonding Jumper**  \n   - Remove any bonding jumper between neutral and ground bars.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Code References**\n- **250.32(B)(1)**: Requires equipment grounding conductor to connect to grounding electrode but **not** to neutral in subpanels.  \n- **250.24(B)**: Neutral-to-ground bond is only permitted at the **main service panel**.  \n- **250.50**: Mandates grounding electrode installation at detached structures.  \n- **250.66**: Grounding electrode conductor sizing based on largest ungrounded feeder conductor.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Bonding neutral and ground bars in a subpanel creates a parallel ground path and violates the \"separately derived system\" grounding rules.  \n   - **Correct Action**: Isolate the neutral and ground bars in the subpanel. The neutral bar should only connect to the feeder neutral conductor, and the ground bar should only connect to the equipment grounding conductor and grounding electrode.\n\n2. **Neutral Bar Bonded to Metal Enclosure**  \n   - **Violation**: Section 250.32(B)(1) prohibits connecting the neutral to the metal enclosure in a subpanel. This creates a direct bond between neutral and ground, which is only permitted at the **main service panel** (Section 250.24(B)).  \n   - **Correct Action**: Remove the bonding jumper between the neutral bar and the metal enclosure. The neutral bar must remain electrically isolated from the enclosure in a subpanel.\n\n3. **Missing Grounding Electrode at Detached Structure**  \n   - **Violation**: Section 250.32(A) mandates a **separate grounding electrode** (e.g., ground rod) at the detached garage unless the subpanel is supplied by a single branch circuit (not the case here).  \n   - **Correct Action**: Install a grounding electrode (e.g., 8 ft copper rod) at the detached garage. Connect it to the ground bar via a grounding electrode conductor sized per Table 250.66 (based on feeder conductor size).\n\n---\n\n### **Correct Configuration**\n1. **Feeder Conductors**  \n   - **Hot/Neutral**: #2 AWG aluminum (2 hots, 1 neutral) connected to the neutral bar.  \n   - **Ground**: #2 AWG aluminum (equipment grounding conductor) connected to the ground bar.  \n\n2. **Panel Bonding**  \n   - **Ground Bar**: Bonded to the metal enclosure (per 250.142(B)).  \n   - **Neutral Bar**: Isolated from the ground bar and enclosure.  \n\n3. **Grounding Electrode System**  \n   - Install a grounding electrode (e.g., ground rod) at the detached garage.  \n   - Connect the electrode to the ground bar using a grounding electrode conductor sized per Table 250.66 (for #2 AWG aluminum feeder, use **#6 AWG copper** or **#4 AWG aluminum**).  \n\n4. **Bonding Jumper**  \n   - Remove any bonding jumper between neutral and ground bars.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Code References**\n- **250.32(B)(1)**: Requires equipment grounding conductor to connect to grounding electrode but **not** to neutral in subpanels.  \n- **250.24(B)**: Neutral-to-ground bond is only permitted at the **main service panel**.  \n- **250.50**: Mandates grounding electrode installation at detached structures.  \n- **250.66**: Grounding electrode conductor sizing based on largest ungrounded feeder conductor.  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",
