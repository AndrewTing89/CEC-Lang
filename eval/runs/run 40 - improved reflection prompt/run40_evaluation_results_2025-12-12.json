This ensures both ungrounded conductors are disconnected together, preventing energized neutrals during maintenance.\n\n2. **Overcurrent Protection**  \n   - **Section 240.4(D)**: For 12 AWG copper conductors (as in 12/3 cable), the maximum overcurrent protection is **20A**.  \n   - **Section 210.4(C)**: Multiwire circuits **shall supply only line-to-neutral loads** (e.g., kitchen receptacles).  \n\n---\n\n### Neutral Conductor Requirements\n1. **Sizing**  \n   - **Section 210.4(D)**: The neutral conductor must be **sized to carry the maximum unbalanced load** (difference between the two ungrounded conductors).  \n   - **Section 200.4(A)**: The neutral conductor must be **the same size as the ungrounded conductors** (12 AWG in this case) unless exceptions apply (e.g., harmonic currents in 3-phase systems—**not applicable here**).\n\n2. **Grouping**  \n   - **Section 210.4(D)**: Ungrounded and grounded conductors **must be grouped** in the same raceway or cable (as in 12/3 cable).  \n   - **Section 200.4(B)**: In enclosures, neutrals must be **identified or grouped** with their associated ungrounded conductors. For 12/3 cable, this is inherently satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### Key Exceptions and Notes\n- **Exception 210.4(C)**: If all ungrounded conductors are opened simultaneously (via handle-tied breakers), the neutral may carry unbalanced loads without additional restrictions.  \n- **Harmonic Currents**: Not a concern for single-phase kitchen circuits (unlike 3-phase systems mentioned in **210.4(A) Informational Note 1**).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n- **Breaker**: Two **20A single-pole breakers with a handle tie** (per 210.4(B) and 240.15(B)(1)).  \n- **Neutral**: **12 AWG** conductor, sized to match the ungrounded conductors (per 210.4(D) and 200.4(A)).  \n- **Installation**: Ensure all conductors originate from the **same panelboard** (210.4(A)) and are grouped in the same cable (12/3).  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

      "answer": "## Subpanel Grounding and Bonding Violations (CEC 2022)\n\n### **Identified Violations**\n1. **Neutral and Ground Bars Bonded Together**  \n   - **Violation**: CEC 2022 **250.24(B)** requires **separate neutrals and grounds** in subpanels. Bonding them creates a parallel path for neutral current, risking overloading the grounding conductor and improper GFCI operation.  \n   - **Correct Configuration**: Neutral and ground bars must be **electrically isolated** in subpanels. The main bonding jumper (connecting neutral and ground) exists **only in the main service panel**.\n\n2. **Neutral Bar Bonded to Metal Enclosure**  \n   - **Violation**: CEC 2022 **250.142(B)** prohibits bonding the neutral to the enclosure in subpanels. This creates a parallel path for fault currents and violates the requirement for a **dedicated neutral-to-ground separation** in subpanels.  \n   - **Correct Configuration**: The neutral bar should only connect to the **feeder neutral conductor** from the main panel.

See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision.

The insulation of conductors shall comply with 620.11(A) through (D).\nInformational Note:  One method of determining that the insulation of conductors is flame retardant is by testing the  conductors  or  cables  to  the  VW-1  (Vertical-Wire) Flame Test in ANSI/UL 1581-2011, Reference Standard for Electrical Wires, Cables, and Flexible Cords .\n(A)  Hoistway Door Interlock Wiring. The conductors to the hoistway door interlocks from the hoistway riser shall be one of the following:\n- (1) Flame retardant and suitable for a temperature of not less than 200°C (392°F). Conductors shall be Type SF or equivalent.\n- (2)  Physically protected using an approved method, such that the conductor assembly is flame retardant and suitable for a temperature of not less than 200°C (392°F).\n(B)  Traveling Cables. Traveling cables used as flexible connections between the elevator or dumbwaiter car or counterweight and the raceway shall be of the types of elevator cable listed in Table 400.4 or other approved types.\n(C)  Other  Wiring. All  conductors  in  raceways  shall  have flame-retardant insulation.\nConductors  shall  be  Type  MTW,  TF,  TFF,  TFN,  TFFN, THHN, THW, THWN, TW, XHHW, hoistway cable, or any other conductor with insulation designated as flame retardant.\nShielded conductors shall be permitted if such conductors are insulated for the maximum nominal circuit voltage applied to any conductor within the cable or raceway system.\n(D)  Insulation. All conductors shall have an insulation voltage rating  equal  to  at  least  the  maximum  nominal  circuit  voltage applied  to  any  conductor  within  the  enclosure,  cable,  or  raceway. Insulations and outer coverings that are marked for limited smoke and are so listed shall be permitted.\n\nResult 2 [CEC 2022 Section 310.14] (relevance: 0.50)\n#### 310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0 Volts-2000 Volts\n\n\n##### (A) General.\n\n- (1) Tables or Engineering Supervision. Ampacities for conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables as provided in 310.15 or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.14(B). ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.\n\nInformational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 12.5.1 in NFPA 79-2018, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .\n\n- (2) Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.\n\n\nException: Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the circuit with lower ampacity does not exceed the lesser of 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.\n\nInformational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.\n\n- (3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed, or the number of conductors, that the limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded. ∆\n\n\nInformational Note No.  1: The temperature rating of a conductor [see Table 310.4(A) and Table 311.10(A)] is the maximum temperature, at any location along its length, that the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The ampacity tables of Article 310 and the ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows:\n\n- (1) Ambient temperature - ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.\n\n- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.\n\n- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.\n\n- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and impeding heat dissipation.\n\n\nInformational Note No.  2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.\n\n##### (B) Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor ampacities shall be permitted to be calculated by means of Equation 310.14(B).\n\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere:\n\nT c = conductor temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nT a = ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n\nRdc = dc resistance of 305 mm (1 ft) of conductor in microohms at temperature, Tc\n\nY c = component ac resistance resulting from skin effect and proximity effect\n\nRca = effective thermal resistance between conductor and surrounding ambient\n\nResult 3 [CEC 2022 Section 330.112] (relevance: 0.45)\n#### 330.112 Insulation\n\nInsulated conductors shall comply with 330.112(A) or (B).\n\n##### (A) 1000 Volts or Less.
