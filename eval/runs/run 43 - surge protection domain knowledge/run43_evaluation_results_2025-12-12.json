This is reserved for the main service disconnect.  \n- **Grounding Electrode Requirement**: A 4-wire feeder to a detached structure **requires** a local grounding electrode (250.32(A)). A single branch circuit is the **only** exception.  \n- **California Specific**: CALGreen (Title 24) mandates grounding electrodes for all new structures, reinforcing 250.32(A).\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

This is reserved for the main service disconnect.  \n- **Grounding Electrode Requirement**: A 4-wire feeder to a detached structure **requires** a local grounding electrode (250.32(A)). A single branch circuit is the **only** exception.  \n- **California Specific**: CALGreen (Title 24) mandates grounding electrodes for all new structures, reinforcing 250.32(A).\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

Key requirements include:\n\n#### **1. Dedicated Circuits for Major Appliances**  \nThe following appliances **require dedicated circuits** (and thus reserved panelboard spaces):  \n- **Electric Ranges/Ovens**: 40–50 A circuit (220.55, 422.13).  \n- **Clothes Dryers**: 30 A circuit (220.54, 422.13).  \n- **Water Heaters**: 30–40 A circuit (422.13).  \n- **Air Conditioners/Heat Pumps**: Dedicated circuit per 440.6(A).  \n- **Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)**: Dedicated circuit per 625.43.  \n\n#### **2. Small Appliance Branch Circuits**  \n- **Kitchen, Dining Room, and Breakfast Nook**: **2 or more 20 A circuits** required (210.11(C)(1)), each occupying a panel space.  \n\n#### **3. General Lighting and Receptacle Loads**  \n- Calculated per 220.12 (1.5 VA/ft² for dwelling units), but **actual panel spaces depend on the number of branch circuits** installed to serve these loads.  \n\n#### **4. Special Equipment**  \n- **Fire Alarms**: Dedicated circuit per 760.41.  \n- **Smoke Alarms**: Dedicated circuit per 720.43.  \n\n---\n\n### **Panelboard Sizing Guidance**  \n- **Minimum Spaces**: A typical single-family dwelling requires **at least 40–60 spaces** to accommodate all required circuits (lighting, receptacles, appliances).  \n- **Future Expansion**: Panelboards should include **reserve spaces** for future additions (e.g., EV charging, solar systems).  \n\n---\n\n### **Inspector Notes**  \n- Verify panelboard location compliance with **240.24(D) and (E)**.  \n- Confirm reserved spaces for **major appliances** match their dedicated circuit requirements.  \n- Ensure panelboard has **sufficient spaces** to avoid overfilling (e.g., 40-space panel for a 200A service is common).  \n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022",

For example, the maximum allowable fill, in mm 2 , for a 150-mm wide cable tray in Column 2 shall be 4200 minus (28 multiplied by Sd) [the maximum allowable fill, in square inches, for a 6-in. wide cable tray in Column 2 shall be 6.5 minus (1.1 multiplied by Sd)].\n\nb The term Sd in Column 2 is equal to the sum of the diameters, in mm, of all cables 507 mm 2 (in inches, of all 1000 kcmil) and larger single-conductor cables in the same cable tray with small cables.\n\n- (2) Ventilated Channel Cable Trays. Where 50 mm (2 in.), 75 mm (3 in.), 100 mm (4 in.), or 150 mm (6 in.) wide ventilated channel cable trays contain single-conductor cables, the sum of the diameters of all single conductors shall not exceed the inside width of the channel.\n\n\n============================================================\n[REFERENCED TABLE DATA - Use these exact values]\n============================================================\n### Table 310.16: Ampacities of Insulated Conductors with Not More Than Three Current-Carrying Conductors in Raceway, \nsize | copper_60c | copper_75c | copper_90c | aluminum_60c | aluminum_75c | aluminum_90c\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n18 |  |  | 14 |  |  | \n16 |  |  | 18 |  |  | \n14 | 15 | 20 | 25 |  |  | \n12 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 15 | 20 | 25\n10 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 25 | 30 | 35\n8 | 40 | 50 | 55 | 35 | 40 | 45\n6 | 55 | 65 | 75 | 40 | 50 | 55\n4 | 70 | 85 | 95 | 55 | 65 | 75\n3 | 85 | 100 | 115 | 65 | 75 | 85\n2 | 95 | 115 | 130 | 75 | 90 | 100\n1 | 110 | 130 | 145 | 85 | 100 | 115\n1/0 | 125 | 150 | 170 | 100 | 120 | 135\n2/0 | 145 | 175 | 195 | 115 | 135 | 150\n3/0 | 165 | 200 | 225 | 130 | 155 | 175\n4/0 | 195 | 230 | 260 | 150 | 180 | 205\n\n**Footnotes:**\n  [1] Section 310.15(B) shall be referenced for ampacity correction factors where the ambient temperature is other than 30°C (86°F).\n  [2] Section 310.15(C)(1) shall be referenced for more than three current-carrying conductors.\n  [3] Section 310.16 shall be referenced for conditions of use.\n  [*] Section 240.4(D) shall be referenced for conductor overcurrent protection limitations, except as modified elsewhere in the Code.\n\n### Table 310.18: Ampacities of Insulated Conductors with Not More Than Three Current-Carrying Conductors in Raceway o\nsize | copper_110c | copper_150c | copper_200c | copper_250c\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n14 | 30 | 34 | 36 | 39\n12 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50\n10 | 50 | 55 | 60 | 60\n8 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100\n\n**Footnotes:**\n  [1] Section 310.15(B) shall be referenced for ampacity correction factors where the ambient temperature is other than 40°C (104°F).\n  [2] Section 310.15(C)(1) shall be referenced for more than three current-carrying conductors.\n  [3] Section 310.18 shall be referenced for conditions of use.\n\n### Table 310.17: Ampacities of Single-Insulated Conductors Rated 0 Through 2000 Volts in Free Air, Based on Ambient A\nsize | copper_60c | copper_75c | copper_90c | aluminum_60c | aluminum_75c | aluminum_90c\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n14* | 25 | 30 | 35 | — | — | —\n12* | 30 | 35 | 40 | 25 | 30 | 35\n10* | 40 | 50 | 55 | 35 | 40 | 45\n8 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 45 | 55 | 65\n6 | 80 | 95 | 105 | 60 | 75 | 80\n4 | 105 | 125 | 140 | 80 | 100 | 110\n3 | 120 | 145 | 165 | 95 | 115 | 130\n2 | 140 | 170 | 190 | 110 | 135 | 150\n1 | 165 | 195 | 220 | 130 | 155 | 175\n1/0 | 195 | 230 | 260 | 150 | 180 | 205\n2/0 | 225 | 265 | 300 | 175 | 210 | 235\n3/0 | 260 | 310 | 350 | 200 | 240 | 275\n4/0 | 300 | 360 | 405 | 235 | 280 | 315\n250 | 340 | 405 | 455 | 265 | 315 | 355\n300 | 375 | 445 | 505 | 290 | 350 | 395\n\n**Footnotes:**\n  [1] Section 310.15(B) shall be referenced for ampacity correction factors where the ambient temperature is other than 30°C (86°F).\n  [2] Section 310.15(D) shall be referenced for more than three current-carrying conductors.\n  [*] Section 240.4(D) shall be referenced for conductor overcurrent protection limitations, except as modified elsewhere in the Code.\n\n============================================================\n[AUTO-INJECTED CROSS-REFERENCES - These sections were referenced above]\n============================================================\n### Referenced Section 695.14\n#### 695.14  Control Wiring.\n(A)  Control Circuit Failures.
