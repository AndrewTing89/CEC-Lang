Other types (e.g., 3, 3R, 4, 4X) do not meet this requirement.\n\n2. **Ice Coverage**:  \n   - A critical footnote (*[*]) mandates that **the enclosure mechanism must remain operable when ice-covered**, regardless of the selected type. This applies to all outdoor enclosures in icy conditions.\n\n3. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - **Type 3SX** includes corrosion resistance (marked under \"Corrosive agents\"), making it ideal for environments with both sleet and chemical exposure.  \n   - **Type 3S** is suitable for general sleet and rain protection without corrosion resistance.\n\n### Inspector Note:  \n- Avoid using enclosures like **Type 3R** or **Type 4** for sleet exposure, as they lack the \"X\" marking in the sleet row of Table 110.28.  \n- Always verify the **mechanism operability under ice** as a separate requirement, even if the enclosure type meets other criteria.\n\n[OK] Source: CEC 2022 Table 110.28"
