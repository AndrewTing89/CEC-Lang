QUESTION: What type of enclosure is suitable for outdoor use with rain, sleet, and ice per Table 110.28?

================================================================================
AGENT ANSWER:
================================================================================

## Suitable Enclosures for Outdoor Use with Rain, Sleet, and Ice (CEC 2022)

**Answer:**
The following enclosure types from **Table 110.28** are suitable for outdoor use with protection against rain, sleet, and ice:

- **Type 3**
- **Type 3R**
- **Type 3S**
- **Type 3X**
- **Type 3RX**
- **Type 3SX**
- **Type 4**
- **Type 4X**
- **Type 6**
- **Type 6P**

### Key Notes:
1. **General Protection**: All listed types provide protection against rain, snow, and sleet (per the "Rain, snow, and sleet" row in the table).
2. **Operability in Ice**: If the enclosure mechanism must remain operable when ice-covered (e.g., switches, breakers), only **Type 3S, 3SX, 4, 4X, 6, or 6P** are required (see the "Sleet*" footnote).
3. **Corrosion Resistance**: For environments with corrosive agents (e.g., coastal areas), select **Type 3X, 3RX, 3SX, 4X, 6P** (marked with "X" in their designation).

ENCLOSURE TYPES LISTED:
✓ Type 3
✓ Type 3R
✓ Type 3S
✓ Type 3X
✓ Type 3RX
✓ Type 3SX
✓ Type 4
✓ Type 4X
✓ Type 6

EXPECTED FULL LIST: 3, 3R, 3S, 3X, 3RX, 3SX, 4, 4X, 6, 6P
AGENT PROVIDED: All 10 types (COMPLETE LIST)

RESULT: ✅ CORRECT

The agent provided the FULL list of all 10 enclosure types suitable for outdoor use with rain, sleet, and ice protection. This is the correct answer - not the partial list (3S, 3SX only) that was a concern in previous tests.

ADDITIONAL QUALITY:
- Properly distinguished between general protection vs. operability during ice
- Added helpful notes about corrosion resistance variants
- Cited correct source (CEC 2022 Table 110.28)
