The earth shall not be considered as an effective fault-current path.\n\nResult 5 [CEC 2022 Section 250.58] (relevance: 0.20)\n#### 250.58 Common Grounding Electrode\n\nWhere an ac system is connected to a grounding electrode in or at a building or structure, the same electrode shall be used to ground conductor enclosures and equipment in or on that building or structure. Where separate services, feeders, or branch circuits supply a building and are required to be connected to a grounding electrode(s), the same grounding electrode(s) shall be used.\n\nTwo or more grounding electrodes that are bonded together shall be considered as a single grounding electrode system in this sense.\n\n\n============================================================\n[REFERENCED TABLE DATA - Use these exact values]\n============================================================\n### Table 250.102(C)(1): Grounded Conductor, Main Bonding Jumper, System Bonding Jumper, and Supply-Side Bonding Jumper for A\nlargest_conductor_copper | largest_conductor_aluminum | grounded_conductor_copper | grounded_conductor_aluminum\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n2 or smaller | 1/0 or smaller | 8 | 6\n1 or 1/0 | 2/0 or 3/0 | 6 | 4\n2/0 or 3/0 | 4/0 or 250 | 4 | 2\nOver 3/0 through 350 | Over 250 through 500 | 2 | 1/0\nOver 350 through 600 | Over 500 through 900 | 1/0 | 3/0\nOver 600 through 1100 | Over 900 through 1750 | 2/0 | 4/0\nOver 1100 | Over 1750 | See Notes 1 and 2. | \n\n**Footnotes:**\n  [1] If the circular mil area of ungrounded supply conductors that are connected in parallel is larger than 1100 kcmil copper or 1750 kcmil aluminum, the grounded conductor or bonding jumper shall have an \n  [2] If the circular mil area of ungrounded supply conductors that are connected in parallel is larger than 1100 kcmil copper or 1750 kcmil aluminum and if the ungrounded supply conductors and the bonding \n  [3] If there are no service-entrance conductors, the supply conductor size shall be determined by the equivalent size of the largest service-entrance conductor required for the load to be served.\n\n### Table 250.3: Additional Grounding and Bonding Requirements\nconductor_equipment | article | section\n--- | --- | ---\nAgricultural buildings |  | 547.9 and 547.10\nAudio signal processing, ampli |  | 640.7\nBranch circuits |  | 210.5, 210.6, 406.3\nCablebus |  | 370.60\nCable trays | 392 | 392.60\nCapacitors |  | 460.10, 460.27\nCircuits and equipment operati | 720 | \nCommunications circuits | 800 | \nCommunity antenna television a |  | 820.93, 820.100, 820.103, 800.\nConductors for general wiring | 310 | \nMedium voltage conductors and  | 311 | \nCranes and hoists | 610 | \nElectrically driven or control |  | 675.11(C), 675.12, 675.13, 675\nElectric signs and outline lig | 600 | \nElectrolytic cells | 668 | \n\n============================================================\n[AUTO-INJECTED CROSS-REFERENCES - These sections were referenced above]\n============================================================\n### Referenced Section 398.104\n#### 398.104 Conductors\n\nConductors shall be of a type specified by Article 310.\n\n### Referenced Section 250.180\n#### 250.180 General\n\nIf systems over 1000  volts are grounded, they shall comply with all applicable requirements of 250.1 through 250.178 and with 250.182 through 250.194, which supplement and modify the preceding sections.",
